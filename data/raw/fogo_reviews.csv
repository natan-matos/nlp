0,"A truly mediocre meal.  We went for Saturday brunch, and were the first table to be seated. Food - The salad bar is very good. Nicely presented and everything was fresh and tasty. The meats were not good.  It's a ""steak house"" they really need to get that part right.  The meat was so dry and overcooked I thought they might be reheated from the previous night. The manager assured us everything was cooked fresh. It did not taste that way. Service - service was attentive friendly and punctual. We spoke to the manager. She listened to out concerns and discounted our meals by $10. I would recommend the salad bar on weekday for lunch at this spot and recommend that you skip the meat.",4.0

2,"We found an amazing deal on instagram for a special price to enjoy this Brazilian bbq. The whole meal is pretty pleasant. There are so much meat, definitely a heaven for meat lovers. The meats quality is nice but some of them are pretty chewy. The buffet bar is so cool. You can enjoy a lot of simple Brazilian cuisine from there. One of my favorite is the Brazilian cheese bread, they are just so yummy, starchy and also airy. I will go there again if they have good deals again. Otherwise, I'm kinda scared to enjoy too much meat for dinner.",4.0
3,So we came downtown today to see a Filipino art festival and decided to eat something that we both have not had in a very long time . We started out with the brunch menu. We tried the salad with a lot of choices . We also ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail. We ordered diet soda to drink and had to ask for it twice . Which they did spill my soda. They come to your table with different varieties of meat options that is on a large spiraled device and the got your meat off from the device into metal plate . The wait to get some of the food is a slow wait as they go to every table . The fill of the place is very inviting and well lit . My overall experience was I would eat here again after learning how the menu itself works . Only negative was understanding how to to turn the cards over to stop food or bring food out . They go over that part very quickly and most are in awe if coming in for the first time . .,3.0
4,"I had always heard of Fogo Dr Chão so I decided to bring my wife here for a Valentine's Day dinner to try it out... I was thinking that the vibe here would be romantic and private due to the price and type of food they served and boy was I wrong... best way I can explain it is as an upscale hometown buffet... the place was pretty packed and the tables had minimal privacy Aside from that surprise though, the food itself was quite delicious and the service was decent! A little hard to understand some of the staff sometimes when they came over, but we tried about 90% of what was on the menu and enjoyed all of it... dessert was tasty, too! I'm not sure I'd come back again, but definitely worth a shot and I'd say still pretty worth the price",5.0
5,"Fogo is a treat every few years. It's not where I'd send visiting friends who only have a few nights in town, but it's a fun experience if you're local or don't have a Brazilian Steakhouse in your home city. My favorite way to do it is with 3-4 friends, but it's fun on a date too. Just come hungry so you can enjoy as much as possible!My favorite is always the lamb. They have both lamb chops and lamb picanha. Everything else is great too. I always leave stuffed. If the meat didn't do it, the cheese bread sure would. I could eat dozens of them. No need to save room for dessert- it's just okay. It's a fun night out!",4.0

The staff is always great, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is always great too. I'd recommend couples and mid to large groups to come here, guaranteed you will not be disappointed. Make a reservation, they'll accommodate you better than just walking in.",4.0

12,"This is an update to my update, regarding the San Diego Fogo de Chao Father's Day mishap.  The one star review is specifically for Father's Day 2023.  Service has always been great.  The issue that day was the over booking and the absence of food on that day at about 2:45 pm. I last stated that due to the Father's Day mishap review, I received a call from Fogo.  Fogo told me that they apologize for the mishap and offered a brief explanation.   That is all I would expect.  They also told me that I would be receiving 4 gift cards to make up for it.  I never received the gift cards, so that is why I made the first update.  I stated that it would have been better to just apologize and not offer the gift cards, than offer the gift cards and never send them.  Today 08/03/2023, I received and call from Fogo.  They said they heard I never received the gift cards as offered during the first call.  They immediately sent the cards while I was on the phone with them.  The cards are appreciated, a lot.  Fogo made things right, since they made the offer.  Way to go Fogo SD.",5.0

14,"This review is an update, to my Father's Day review.  *See Father's Day review.   I received a telephone call from a female manager from Fogo, but the call went to voicemail.  I called the number back and spoke to the manager.  She was very kind and listened to my concerns.  The manger explained how the problem stemmed from Open Table.  The manger apologized and advised me that she would make it right.  The manger asked how many people were in my party on Father's Day.  I informed her that it was me, my wife and two of my sons.  The manager stated she would send coupons for free meals, for me and my family that accompanied me on Father's Day.  The coupons were for free meals, good at any Fogo restaurant.  Well, Father's Day was a long time ago.  I still haven't received any follow up email, call or contact in any way.So... I had a bad Father's Day and I received ""LIP SERVICE"" (false promises) afterwords.  Sad...I was hoping to update my review with good news.  Sad to say, I cannot.  It would have been better to respond to the review with an apology or explanation, rather than false promises.  No big deal.... I just won't spend my time or money at Fogo San Diego.",1.0
15,"This rating is specifically for today.... Father's Day 06/18/2023.  I love Fogo de Chao, but today was horrible.  My wife made Father's Day lunch reservations for 2:00 pm.  When we arrived, there was a large group of people outside waiting.  We checked in and they could not give us a wait time.  After over 30 minutes, I noticed tables in the bar area, where I have never seen tables before.  The tables were empty.  Nobody was actively being seated there, at that time.  I asked if our party of four could sit there. The staff member said we could sit there and escorted us in.  I asked if we could immediately go to the self serve area and begin grabbing our sides.  They said we could.  We walked over and grabbed a plate.  I noticed the self serve bar area was empty, meaning the trays were bare and no food was available.  The hot plates did not have any food there either.  I put my plate down and told my family that we were leaving.  How can I have a satisfactory time eating, when there is no food???    I have never been to Fogo De Chao and received bad service.  Nor, have I ever been there when the self service bar had NO FOOD!!   This was sad.  The manger should be reprimanded for this.  I believe the restaurant was DOUBLE OR TRIPLE BOOKED.  This was poor management of the facility.  The reputation of the restaurant was tarnished.  I should have taken pictures, but I was not happy and I just wanted to leave. Pictures would have been great. I believe that the next time I go to the restaurant, it will be better.   Way better!!!! The service will be great and there will plenty of food.  So much food that I will have to turn the red side of my card up.   Again... this rating is specifically for Father's Day 06/18/2023.",1.0
16,"Last night was my first night going to this place. I have been to other Brazilian Steak Houses, but never this one.I give the place a 3.5.  The restaurant is pretty.  The service was excellent. Thank you Matt! The food was just ok.  The salad bar was a little underwhelming.  Although the meat selections were plentiful, some of the meats could have used a bit more flavor.  The mashed potatoes that came with our meal were pretty good thou. All and all we had a nice experience, but I see this place as a one and done for myself.",1.0

18,"I would rated 2 stars, but Mike bumped it up 1 star. Only thing great about this place is Mike The Lamb Guy! He is usually chicken, but tonight he was lamb. He helped us get the specific meats we wanted since we kept getting the same 4 meats... the drinks were mid. The meats were mid. Our actual server we saw like 2 times. But Mike was able to attend to us.When we got there we got a drink at the bar. The bartender seemed like she was still training. It took forever to get our drinks, and by the time we got them we were called to be seated already.Most of the servers didn't seem like they wanted to work there. Only Mike seemed happy to be there. We went here for our anniversary, and in the beginning they said we would get a dessert. But we were there for so long, we didn't bother getting a dessert. Overall, only come here for one reason: Mike.",4.0

20,"I used to go here for every occasions from birthday to wedding anniversary but Covid happens, so I stopped and waited for so long, I finally remember I had a $15 promo card from Yelp Elite so I can use it toward lunch. Getting here was not easy as usual it's located in downtown and it's lunch time so parking will be tricky, but dinner could be worse when it's night time and everyone going downtown for clubbing and food or games.Anyway I am too familiar with the concept of Fogo where you paid a fixed price then have the staff bring out variety of meats and you get to use the tongs to hold the meat while they cut it to your plate. The meal included a salad bar and some basic meats but you know which one you would like. I used to go for the fatty meat like Picanha and since I went here when I was still overweighed, I already stuffed myself with everything they brought out mostly sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, not the good quality meats, then I felt they might be did the meat rotation out of order on purpose, so that you get full faster, and most of the guys who cut the meats were not very friendly or chatty, they always seem a bit rushed, not sure why, maybe still trying to be nice to them or you might get a tough chewy cut LOL, so only your server will be your friend in this case.Then later I found out if you wanted specific meats, you can ask, it's not always guaranteed you would get it right away but at least I learnt from eating slower and growing more patiently. So I get to try all that I missed in the past including lamb chops, lamb sirloin, a better cut of steaks where inside still a little pink but it tasted so juicy and sweet, it melted in my mouth, I get to try the plantain I normally skipped, caramelized pineapples also cool, explored a bit more on the salad bar which I usually went straight for meats.Overall the experience was pretty pleasant, drinks and desserts are separated, they also have appetizers and a la carte items for order.At the end they didn't honor my $15 because they said it was expired, yes I noticed, but as many promos or coupons etc in my past experience they can't be voided until redeemed even if it was expired, let alone it was little over 6 months, they tried to avoid this by giving me a 10% discount which is fine to me. The total came out to about $50 for lunch, I paid more when I go to buffet to the casino, but I will let this one slight, inflation really made everything higher in cost, but people earning still the same, very unfortunate, but I did miss the time when fogo lunch was $35 per person and dinner for two only $65, and it was just 7 years ago. Well fogo stood still over time, I can't drive to Vegas or Los Angeles, guess I am sticking with this location :) until next time",4.0

22,"18$ lunch price for an extensive unlimited salad bar might be the best deal in sd. Plenty of plant based options, which are clearly stated on little name cards. The hummus says vegetarian but after asking the server they had clarified that it was vegan.Great for groups with people of different dietary preferences. Our group consisted of three salad bar and two full menu. Some of their cocktails have happy hour deals which is ALL DAY  I'd suggest trying the Brazilian soda, it's refreshing and sweet. The strawberry hibiscus  caipirinha was also good (super sweet).overall great experience for this first timer.",3.0

26,I have been coming here since it opened. My last two experiences were very disappointing. When I was there on Saturday to celebrate my son and my birthdays. We were well into eating before a server even came to our table. I had to ask every time we needed a water refill and the meat service was the slowest it's ever been. We wanted to continue eating but finally after 30 minutes of no meat brought to our table we gave up and left. Last month I ate at the location in Las Vegas and had an amazing experience. Unfortunately the San Diego location has gone downhill drastically with Service and I'm very disappointed as it was one of my very favorite places to celebrate in San Diego.,5.0

28,"First time trying Fogo de Chao and I loved their concept! I really like how interactive, interesting, and fun dining at this restaurant was. I loved the dark and romantic ambiance this place had. The bar was filled with great sides to choose from that is available throughout your meal. The runners come over to your table to serve cuts of meat. Unfortunately, I waited over 20 minutes for our server to help us out. I ended up just going to the bar to grab the sides. When the server finally came and helped us out, they forgot to give us utensils so a runner had to grab it for us. The meats came over very slowly and I got full from just waiting. I really liked the overall vibe and concept of this place, but service could have been better.",4.0
29,"Fogo de Chao $39 special (B-)So I went for this yesterday with my wife & daughter. It's a fun experience - haven't had buffet in a long time - and for $39 / person, it's a decent value. But don't expect very high standards for ambiance, service or food. I'd give it a B- overall, so not bad, but not great. The ambiance is hectic and loud. The one I went to in Kansas was quite different - much ""higher end"". But I think a big part of that is driven by how busy they were, and how tight the tables were bunched together. I had 6:15pm reservations, but don't think we were seated till 6:30pm. And I had to explicitly tell them I want the $39 menu, meaning there are a few meats I don't get. In hindsight, a great decision Salad bar had some good items, but overall, probably the weak link in terms of food. It was messy, depleted items weren't readily replenished (like soup & bread), and can't say the food was very tasty overall. Not bad, but overall, can't consider it ""good"" either.As for the meats - I think I tried everything except for the bacon wrapped chicken. The good, ranked: 1) Lamb (B+) nicely seasoned and cooked2) Pork ribs (B) good crust, appropriately seasoned3) Picanha (B) nicely seasoned, full flavored meatThe majority of meats, however, were overcooked and under-seasoned. Fun to be served, but the eating was pretty underwhelming. Essentially, all other meats were C to B-, mostly falling into the C+ category given meats are supposed to be their specialty. I actually didn't take pictures because it was too hectic, dark, and difficult to tell what's what by just looking at a cut piece of meat. Conclusion: reasonable to try out - it's kind of fun - and probably better to go on a week night than weekend. Manage your own expectations for the food and you should be fine. But if you're after good tasting meat, I feel you get a more satisfying meal eating Korean BBQ, essentially at the same price.",3.0

31,"This was an interesting experience that I have never had before. The model is an all you can eat steakhouse where they come around with steaks on skewers and cut you off different pieces. I did really enjoy it and had a nice time. The salad/vegetable appetizer bar area had a lot of unique and tasty options. My only issue with the whole thing was that for the same price I could have ordered a fantastic filet mignon meal at a normal steakhouse cooked to perfection. While some of the steak that was brought around was good, I would say the majority of it was not exactly my favorite. Tougher, lower quality cuts of steak was what they brought around the most and it took me eating pieces of all of them to really figure out what all the different options even were being that they had a lot of random cuts and preparation methods, some of which were Brazilian style.",4.0

The etiquette when you are dining is you flip your card over to green, that means that you want served meat or whatever they are bringing around the tables.

All of the staffs are so nice! Everybody came by so often to make sure our empty plates got taken away and drinks always full.Love it! Let's talk about the most important part! The food! We did all you can eat and it's well worth it! The meats keep coming non-stop! Don't miss the pork ribs and everything that wrap in bacon! They are so good! Those grilled pineapple are awesome! Don't forget to visit their salad bar which is awesome and I think my favorite in that salad bar was fresh watermelon with jalapeños and blue cheese! It's amazingly good! I went back for it 3 times! Overall this place is well worth it.",2.0
38,"This place was quite a let down after seeing so many positive reviews. The meat servers were pretty condescending. I simply asked what kind of cut this is because some of the servers just throw a piece of meat at you and don't speak. I simply wanted to educate myself on what kind of cut it is, and they were so rude and said it's beef, well of course I know it's beef, there's various cuts of beef. To state the obvious and be so rude about it was so offputting. I also asked for beef ribs because it was on the menu but they never offered through like 3/4 of my time there. And when they finally serve me a slice, it was literally the end cut that was full of seasoning and super lean and dry and they wonder why I didn't eat it? They really think they can just give awful cuts and expect customers to pay a premium for it. We wanted medium rare cuts and the majority was like medium to well done. When we asked for medium rare section, they just ignored and cut whatever piece they felt like which was usually not well done. This the first and last time I will ever dine here. I was expecting great quality medium rare cuts and customer service and we got neither of them. I brought my parents to come here too and I was so embarrassed at the quality of the meats and the awful customer service.",5.0

43,"Where do I begin, our reservation was for 6:15pm and we were sat down accordingly. One thing I will say is that they are pushing their maximum capacity and the tables/chairs were back to back with barely any walking room. The place was extremely crowded for a Sunday night but we tried to make the best of it since we were celebrating our anniversary before we get married in 7 months. Our server took our drink order and explained the buffet/experience. We went through the buffet and we're confused by what was offered but we grabbed some items as the meat was our main focus for dinner. Once our server brought us bread, mashed potatoes, and our drinks, he completely disappeared. We were offered 3-4 meat options and took what we wanted but after that, this is when the night went down hill and was ruined. Not one server came to our table to refill our drinks/water or clear our plates. We kept trying to make eye contact with the servers to get more meat but as soon as they looked our way, they zoomed to the back of the room and never came to our table. We even tried to wave over a few of them and they only went to certain tables that large groups. At one point, I asked a bar back if I could have another glass of wine and if they could send someone over with a meat option. He brought me the glass of wine and said someone would be over but after 30 minutes, we still didn't have anyone come close to our table. Even the table to the left and right of us were upset by the poor service and felt that the other side of the restaurant with the large groups were getting all of the attention. Eventually I asked a server who walked by if we could speak to a manager because we were starving and only had 3 pieces of meat at this point. He said he would send them over and refilled our waters. I believe a manager came over with meat soon after but didn't state she was management. She only asked if we wanted meat and then left. We accepted the meat but after waiting so long, we lost our appetite and just wanted to leave. We asked another random server for the check and she brought it over right away. As we were waiting for our card to be returned, no manager came up to us but 4 other servers with meat swarmed our table asking if we wanted more. At this point we were even more annoyed and declined as we were already there for 1.5 hours. The server who we asked to get a manager did check on us again and asked if they came by our table but I let him know that no one had come. I told him we were leaving and he apologized but it was a little too late. I've had this restaurant on my visit list for a year now and was so excited to try it but was completely let down by the service, noise level, and packed room. It's unbelievable how many servers and people they had running around without even serving the guests. I will say that the restrooms were clean and nice. The meat that we did have was good but not amazing. I don't think we will come back since it was such a special night that was ruined. Especially since we paid almost $200 for a few pieces of meat and a few glasses of wine. Such a let down to be still hungry and leave to go eat elsewhere!",3.0

I have always known that and Happily add on Add  on countless drinks and if i'm craving sweet why not...  There was no indication of their being an up charge....  Iif it wasn't over 50% of what I paid for my food I wouldn't be as offended . Meal was $45.50 each and  The Surprise 5 shrimp cocktail a wapping $26 They usually come to your table with all the meats, and they ask if you want any sides no additional charge.  They will come with the menu if you want any of the drinks and dessert clearly stating how much .That is  how it has has been in the practice Always.  Service was as expected very nice  food was good  dinks are part of why I kept coming back.

The hosts even sat us down quicker since another 2 top cancelled! We always prefer the Churrasco Experience for $65 each for CONTINUOUS TABLESIDE SERVICE OF SIGNATURE CUTS OF FIRE-ROASTED MEAT Yum!!!! The employees walk around with different types of meet and approach depending if the card on your table is green. You either say yes or no to the meat. My favorites are the PICANHA, Bone-in Ribeye, FILET MIGNON, and lamb chops. I always get so full and can never get around to dessert! One day I will lol. Also recommend these drinks nonalcoholic Guaran- Antarctica Orwith alcohol STRAWBERRY HIBISCUS CAIPIRINHA",4.5

51,"Absolutely nothing makes up for time wasted at a location that carries a name that is recognized globally.To make a reservation for my wife and in laws for their birthday to celebrate. Only to be met with service that would have been trumped by outback steakhouse. In fact maybe Chick fila, on a Sunday at that.Waiting 30 minutes for a high chair? Forgetting whos at the table? Waiting hours for meat and filling up their stomachs on the charcuterie, and salad. My in-law had mentioned his favorite choice of meat was the romaine! Just because a fresh cut was brought out doesn't justify the time wasted.Their first time at that! A first experience at what should be considered world class. If you're attempting to go here, especially military in area. Don't expect the type of service and standard that should be given at this sort of establishment.Unreal and in many ways unforgivable. Waiting nearly half an hour just to pay? Big mistakes were made today. If you're planning to go here and aren't a party of 7+. I'd wait until they've got some sort of training going rather than handing out meats that take time to prepare. I hear they were passing it out like it was the Oprah show.Congrats to anyone that went here today and received whole picanha! That covers your bill and then some, I'm sure plenty was wasted. Just like my family's time was.",4.0

53,"My girlfriend & I had the afternoon off so decided to go in for lunch. The hostess that greeted us was very welcoming. We were a little early for our reservation so we waited at the bar. I ordered the Strawberry Hibiscus Caipirinha. The bartender was very friendly. He took the time to explain to us that Caipirinha is Brazils national cocktail. For lunch we both ordered the Gaucho Lunch. There were plenty of of fresh, yummy options. There was even very delicious watermelon juice provided. Our waiter, Javier checked on us often. He answered all of our questions & provided us excellent service. I will definitely be back to try dinner & brunch.",5.0

55,"My Family and I have been going to Fogo de Chao since they opened here in San Diego.  A lot of our celebrations have celebrated at this restaurant. We have always had the best service and best time, but this past Sunday on Father's Day was not one of those times. It was awful.We had a reservation, and we had to wait over an hour for our table. Once we got in, there was barely any food at the salad bar, and we waited at least 30-40 min before any meat came to our table. There was just so many people, it was difficult to walk to get back to our table let alone the salad bar. It was just all around bad and poor planning on their part. And then at the end, it took them forever to bring out our bill and pay for it. I was definitely not worth the $66.50 per person. The only reason I gave this place 3 stars was because the staff was really trying, but they were all so over-worked and stressed that our waitresses and waiters just disappeared and forgot about us. And I know that Management really screwed them over with for their lack of planning. Definitely a Father's Day to remember in a bad way. I will probably steer clear of this place on Father's Day moving forward.",5.0
56,"Ambience: Came here for a date night with my SO and definitely would come again. The dim lighting really set the mood and it felt very intimate. We're both big foodies from Hawaii so we really appreciate a good spot.Food: My favorites of the night: Costala, picanha, filet mignon, the cheese bread, a grilled cheese with honey, caramelized bananas, grilled pineapple. My SO's favs: bacon wrapped filet, bone-in ribeye, picanha, the cheese bread, and the caramelized bananas. The help yourself appetizer bar was alright. The beets and orange slice combo was surprisingly refreshing. I also liked the roasted garlic and mushrooms to eat with my steak. The garlic butter steak(?), eggplant and sliced cheese were my least favorite. Didn't take pics of the meat because we were indulging the whole time but it was GOOD!Service: The night started off a bit slow, but after the manager checked in with us, the meat came very promptly. ""Mike the chicken guy"" truly made our experience over the top here though. Not only did he attend to our table frequently, but he remembered both our preferred temp for the meat selection. He also honored any additional requests for certain meats that we wanted to try that weren't already circling around.",1.0
57,"Came here with great expectations because I had heard great things! They were very accommodating and got us a table even thought we didn't have a reservation.However the table that we got was in the back against the wall, so they were rarely coming by with any food. Our waitress was on top of it however and apparently put in the order for them to come by, after about another 10-15 minutes of waiting again no one came by, I think by that time we only had 2 types of meat. So she again came by apologized and said she's going to let the manager know. After that they had brought the meats we were finally waiting for (ribeye and fillet).When meat did come it was good! A little on the rare side which wasn't a problem for me but a little for my fiancé. The sides were good, the salad bar I would ignore. Overall I took it down two stars because of service (frequency of the different meats) and the salad bar was not impressive at all.",3.0

63,"Made reservations for 6pm, i was in line to check in before 6pm. Was not able to check in until 6:10 due to the line being so long. It is now 6:20 and I'm still waiting to be seated for my 6pm reservation. We are not starting off good. It is now 6:40pm we have not been seated and after asking how much longer we were told 20 more ministers. NEVER in my life have I made reservations and had to wait over an hour to be seated, not even at 5 star fine dinning restaurants! The entire hour we waited to be seated the hostess with the black short bob hair was obnoxiously chewing her gum and was on her phone. I suggest you guys properly train her, her attitude towards everyone who approached her was horrible. When calling the name of whoever was next she never went outside to see if they were out there or in the bar area (keep in mind the entire entrance was packed with people trying to avoid the cold outside, so people had to go either to the bar or outside, which again were extremely crowded).As soon as we were seated we placed our order for drinks. 1 mango habanero caipirinha and 1 beer, 45 minutes the beer never arrived so we canceled it and order a whiskey drink which took 15 min. We were told this place offers 16 different types of meats etc., we only were offered 9. Everyone working here aside from one of the managers and 2 waiters (one had a band aide on his right cheek and another gentleman with blonde hair and glasses) were too busy tending to the big parties. These two waiters made sure everyone had the same service regardless of how big of a party you were (bigger party bigger tip). As for the food, our entire dinner we waited for the black beans to make an appearance. We kept getting told 30 more min, 30 more min. We requested the cheese bread which didn't arrive until 1:30 later, we requested for the banana and fried cheese (maybe) platter you get as you get seated well it never arrived, we requested for the grilled cheese and honey and it probably took well over an hour as well. Keep in mind we easily requested/followed for each item over 5 times. Food was okay but we did not want to request for a specific temperature or rarity since everything else was taking over an hour to arrived. This was not the type of experience we were hoping to when we came here to celebrate.",1.0
64,"Been to a few fogo de chao's and this is at the top of the list.  This place gets really busy so a reservation is a must.  Even with a reservation we waited another 30 minutes at the bar area.  Once we were seated, we waited another 30 minutes after we ordered to get our first taste of the meats.  We went on Veterans Day and Veterans are half off so it was packed.  I spoke to the manager and then we started getting fed.  Always a great experience and fogo, this one just took some patience to get to the good stuff.   Recommend the churassco which is: Continuous tableside service of fire-roasted meats, plus Market Table & Feijoada Bar and Brazilian sidesParking:  there is a structure right up the block which is about $5 for the evening.",4.0
65,"Wanted an easy dinner and it's right down the street so we went on a Thursday night. We were seated at 7:15, but the waitress seemed careless and done for and saw us 3 times during the whole time. 2 for seating and giving us the check.My biggest complaint is the frequency. Between 7:15-745 pm, only 3 steaks were offered to me. Yes, I checked the times. I saw others were also waiting and wondering. So I had the salad bar. During my entire visit, I was offered filet mignon and ny strip once each. The carvers are all very nice, however, they don't care about the yes/no sign. They ask regardless. The whole experience felt off given I've been to other locations. It almost felt as if I'm supposed to eat the salad bar, cheesy breads, plantains, and mashed potatoes, all being starch to fill up so I can eat less meat.To top it off, I sat near the front, but I can hear the two front lady's just cracking jokes and hysterically laughing to themselves. As I was leaving, they were casually lounging around the waiting area and telling stories. Very unprofessional, so I'll leave a photo. This was the worst location compared to Irvine and DC, but I'll give 3 stars to give the benefit of the doubt in case it was just an off day.",4.0

67,Fogo is such a great place to go when celebrating! Servers are super attentive and you can request for any of the meats that are on the churrasco experience.My personal favorite definitely the picanha! Not too much fat but lots of flavor.

71,"The family decided to celebrate Veterans Day with a buffet at Fogo, a well-sought Brazilian steak house, on 6th Ave. in downtown San Diego.We heard this place is endorsed well including the positive reviews it inherited over the years on Yelp and various advisory tip platforms on the web.The initial experience went downhill with the reservation that was made at 2:00 pm.  Understandably, it was quite a busy day. On this day, Fogo offered discounted meals for active duty personnel & retirees - 50% and for each dependent - 10%.  The line was long and learned that majority of the people waiting patiently in line have all made the reservation (1.0).At this point, there was no differentiation between those who made the reservation and those who came in on a walk-in basis.  We didn't get seated until 3:00 pm; an hour after our confirmed reservation.As we were seated, the servers were accommodating and uniformly suited for the fancy dine-in encounter.  There was the salad bar and the main entrees on the skewers were paraded accordingly.  The variety of beef in primal cuts was all tasty, flavorful and juicy.  Although, we felt we had to catch their attention for the offering. (4.0).When it came to billing, it reminded me of the virtue of honesty.  Although it may not have been intentionally distorted, the calculation of the bill was way off from what was advertised for the discounted meals for veterans.  We were charged the dinner rate instead of lunch.  Long story short, the bill was modified after letting them know that 1. we were given a lunch menu, 2.  dinner starts at 2:30 pm when the server initially stated at 2:00 pm.  Given the benefit of the doubt, I am hoping that this was an honest mistake from the server.  But we felt she was a little argumentative until we presented the server of the facts - lessons learned:  be knowledgeable and be aware (1.0).Again, I would like to emphasize that the food here is amazing.  I would certainly visit again in the future.  This review is merely based on the experience we received on Veterans Day.  I look forward to providing this place with a positive review next time we pay a visit.",5.0

The ambience was great understanding that there was a San Diego padres game that had just finished a number of people who came in dressed for the game, and already liquored up was the only issue I had. Not the restaurant, but the goofy people who were there enjoying themselves a little too much.The meats were select and delicious, their honey cheese was amazing, and the salad bar was out of this world. Our servers were outstanding and very attentive and the drinks were very strong. I would recommend anybody who has not tried a Brazilian steakhouse, and is in San Diego, to try this one out.",2.0

Wide variety of delicious meats to choose from and you can frequently chose your cooked preference (well, medium, rare, etc) The sides and buffet are delightful as well. We came for brunch and there was a delicious yogurt parfait and some honey bacon that were both out of this world! All day happy hour means $7 wine and $5 beers all day. We spent about $120 for two people for weekend lunch. Not the most inexpensive but definitely worth it if you're hungry! All the servers are friendly as well so don't be afraid to ask questions!",5.0

77,"I was pretty concerned coming to this location after reading a lot of bad reviews about the service, but I had an exceptional experience today. My husband and I came for brunch at around 12:15. The hostess was very friendly and asked us if we were celebrating anything. We were seated immediately and our waiter explained the menu and options. We chose the full churrasco experience which was a buffet salad and brunch bar, sides and tons of table side meat options. Service: The churrasco experience requires great service and that is what we got. Meats came out hot and fast right after we were seated. They had plenty of staff serving meat, bussing tables and getting us clean plates and checking to see if we wanted anything specific. When we made a request for the beef ribs, we got it within 5 minutes. Finally, we had a gift certificate that we were not given the card number for from the gift giver and the manager, Roberto, told me to call back with the card numbers when I could get them. I could not believe that exception service and level of trust. I was able to call back with the numbers in the evening for him to process. Food: I think we tried almost all of the vast variety of meats that came around and everything was great. My favorite was the prime cut of top sirloin and top sirloin. The lamb, Parmesan pork, bacon wrapped steak and fried cheese with honey were also contenders. I didn't care for the bacon wrapped chicken or the pork ribs as they were a little dry, but I can't complain. Each of the steaks had a nice char and seasoned outside. Steaks were well cooked and juicy. The buffet salad bar had so many options from cold grilled vegetables, meat and cheeses, fresh fruits, cold salads, an omelette bar and waffle station. The waffles were surprisingly delicious with a cinnamon tasting batter. On our table, they brought cheese bread, mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas. The cheese bread wasn't great, but the potatoes were smooth and buttery and a good compliment to the steaks. The banana were delicious and went great with the waffles as a dessert. They also had some sort of parfait, which was ok. Value: I would definitely recommend going for brunch or lunch as the value is well worth it at $47 per person. You get the same meats as dinner and it's $20 less per person and you can be full all day and likely skip dinner like I did. Also, the restaurant is very large and it was not very crowded for brunch, so I think that helped with how fast we were able to be served and attended to. Ambiance: The restaurant is great for a date or special occasion. We had a really great experience and I'd certainly return for a special occasion.",4.0
78,"Even one star is too much for this place. Why?1- This place is cramped. There is no space between the seats.2- Staff are rude, short, and very slow. They make you suffer so you leave sooner. We sat for 45 minutes to get started.3- They didn't serve certain types of meat. For example, it took them 90 minutes to bring us the lamb racks.4- Prices are very high. The meat taste gamey and low quality.5- Hard to find a parking in downtown.

Our server was very charismatic and made our dining experience even more pleasant. I loved almost all the meats I tried, except maybe one or two. My favorite was the lamb and one of the cuts of steak. I love the attention to detail they have here. My boyfriend will only eat his meat cooked medium well, while I like mine medium rare. The servers would remember and come back with a different sticks of meat for both of us. We especially appreciated that they gave us a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary! We could pick any dessert from the menu, and we chose the chocolate molten cake. SO DELICIOUS!!I wasn't too much of a fan of their market table bar.

When we asked for a certain cut of meat that hasn't come by, they bring it right away.  Even when something at the salad bar is out, they'll get more and bring it right to your table.  They also gave us a free dessert to go because we were celebrating a birthday.  Overall such a great value for great quality food and fantastic service.  Compared to the one in LA, which is much bigger, I felt much more taken care of at this location.  Will definitely come again!",5.0

The selections being served at the salad bar never ceased to amaze and we were catered to as though it were our last meal - it might have been had we not stopped eating. If you are looking for ""The Spot"", look no further.

91,"So far I have been to 4 Fogo De Chaos, and this one was the worst and extremely disappointed. If I hadn't been to other locations I would never eat here. First of all, we were seated far from salad bar- and next to a huge party. So we were basically ignored by the meat guys. They would go by us to get around the table and either run out of meat or ignore my daughter as she cutely waved for them. In order to get the meat service for our table, I would have to flag down the server and ask for certain meats. It was so sad, and I have never experienced that. We did have 2 of the meat guys go and get my daughters favorite meats because they kept seeing her with an empty plate. After being there 1 hour, my daughter had hardly been served and definitely didn't get her money's worth. It was a HUGE waste of my $$$$ and she was so sad, all she wanted to do was go back to hotel. I decided to order salmon- hoping to avoid all the salt and meat sweats. It was SUPER SUPER over cooked and SALT CITY.  So, my meal was also not eaten. I did go to the salad bar, and when I went almost 1 whole side was ice with nothing, so I thought they might add more items, but when we left it was still pretty bare. We sat so far from it and I felt so uncomfortable having to weave around so many tables, I didn't go back to get anything. In all this was a 2.5 out of 5 experience.",4.0

94,"First time at this location. It has potential but needs improvements on a few areas. We have been to Fogo at other locations in NorCa and the concept is basically AYCE meats that's cooked and brought to your table. The carver carves you the slice that you want and off they go to the next table. We arrived 3 mins before our reservation and checked in. There were ppl standing around and not sure if they had reservations or not but looks like everyone's waiting. It was Saturday at 12:57pm. We waited a good 5-7mins. Got seated and had wine and drink menus. They have all day HH on certain cocktails, beer and wine. $5-$9 price range. I had a glass of the HH Chardonnay while my grown kids had 2 different cocktails. Cocktails were a bit watered down. It's a shame. We all grabbed a plate of the salad bar and kinda waited around for the meats to come. And waited. The sides they usually comes out - plantains, mash potatoes, etc didn't come and I had to ask for them. The bread poppers were out fairly quickly but we also ate quickly. I had to stop us as we will get too full from everything but the meats. Meats finally came around. Again it was slow. No chicken hearts at all available. Service was ok. Nice servers but getting something always took some time or we had to tell 2 different servers. Overall ok.",3.0

104,"We visited the San Diego location while in town for a business/ personal weekend adventure. Although not our first experience at a location, it was superior. As always, great food and ambiance. However , our server , Rose , was one in a million. Fantastic personality, just attentive enough , made every table feel special. Great laugh and true respect for all employees. It was evident that he is an amazing person and employee. Thank you Rose! You are a diamond in the ruff. Side note: Entire staff seemed to be working as s unit, including the managers. Great to see a crew work so we'll together.",3.0
105,"I received a call, along with an apology and gift card to come back and give them a second chance. It was my birthday so we decided to come celebrate here. I called ahead and the reservation was set. We were seated fast even though there were lots of people waiting. This time they had different sides, that looked fresh and delicious. My favorite was the sweet potato casserole! My oh my: as soon as we flipped the circle to green we were bombarded with meat. I was very surprised since I thought it would be the opposite due to a larger crowd. There were a lot more workers too and in a better mood.The manager, strawberry blonde female, was so sweet and provided complimentary dessert for my birthday! I'm very happy we came here again and I'm excited to be back soon.",4.0
106,"My husband and I tried Fogo on a Sunday evening. We were able to make reservations online without problem. We had a hard time finding parking since, of course, it is located in gaslamp. We were seated right away. -1 star for the selection of sides; very limited to be honest and they looked old and soggy. -1 star for the service. We had about three different servers and we were not sure who we had to ask for any of our requests. In addition, they didn't seem very happy to be there or taking requests. -1 star for the fact that we only got to eat 3 rounds of meat, 5 for my husband, in 2 hours! the meat servers were skipping our table constantly regardless of our green circle/paper that states you'd like some meat. We were seated in a very tight spot, literally in the middle of where doors are supposed to close, and they were going from one big table to the other. I heard our neighbors also complain about this too. I basically kept myself full with the edible sides because the meat was just not coming, even after placing a request with one of the servers. The quality of meats is great but it was taking just way too long we gave up. If you know what I mean by rounds and how little they give you per round, you'd be surprised too! We received a complimentary desert? Not sure why? But we appreciate that. I don't know when and if we will be back, but if we are I'd definitely be in full Karen mode demanding meats LOL.",4.5
107,"Food quality and taste was GREAT! Staff were very friendly! However, the meat that was coming by our table was always the same... it was hard for us to try everything or get everything because we were hungry, but kept getting the same 4 types of cuts... we even had to have someone notify someone else to bring us the pineapple...Also, when bringing food around the tables I assumed the food/drinks were on the house.. the workers don't let you know you have to pay extra for the food or drinks that aren't on the buffet menu... I was brought a drink being asked if i would like to try. If I'm being asked to try something I'd assume it was free... that's a strange way to ask someone to try something but charge them for it... marketing tactics I guess to push more sales...",4.0

109,"Came here with a group of 9 on a weekday. We were seated (made a reservation) and were served quickly. Most of us ordered the Special (all you can eat). The meats came around the table relatively quickly and we were given sizable portions. The food was good! I especially liked the grilled pineapples, the forever replenished sides bar, and cheesy breads. Everyone that served us was kind and gracious. Our Waitress (Daasha), was very friendly and patient with us as we asked to have our checks split. She took the time throughout the night to check up on us and make sure all of our orders were here on time. We had a great group dinner and would suggest any meat lovers to come here!",4.0

111,"Not our first time at FdC, but our first time at this location.  Went for a birthday brunch and going to say overall the experience on this day was lackluster and very underwhelming. The hostess service was amazing, the table main servers were awesome too.  Both 5*. Where FdC failed this day is the main reason most people go to a Brazilian churrascaria. Good tasting meat and LOTS of it.  Unfortunately at our table, even with green showing all day, the visits were very sparse and limited.  And while I've complained about places like TdB having too MUCH salt,  FdC today was very stingy with seasoning, even with the garlic steak.  This is the first time I've really wished there was salt and pepper on the table.  Today was just really average.Ps. The drinks were pretty good though",5.0

116,"My review will be focused mainly on their lunch special. I haven't had the pleasure of eating their all you can eat for dinner. However, i think the best deal here is their lunch special. Go for the market table + meat for $25. the Market table is all you can eat of cold cuts, salads, soups, etc... and it's so tasty.  Sort of like a massive charcuterie board.  I couple it with the Picanha meat and think it's a great deal and super filling. When my 50th comes up, I hope to do their full all you can eat meat selection for dinner.",5.0
117,"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! Made reservation 2 weeks in advance and then could not get a table! They had the reservation but gave to others. Why have reservations.

The caprese salad is one of the best I've had, and they gave so much smoked salmon I was making nova lox bagels for breakfast for days. Excellent filet mignon. The salmon could have been a little more moist imo.",5.0
120,"Had an amazing time with Mike the chicken guy at Fogo. Love his personality and his service made the evening really enjoyable. The main thing you need to know about Fogo is to get the filet mignon and beef ribs, 10/10 recommend these cuts. If they don't pass by your table, you can ask any server and they'll grab it for you. The ambience is nice here. They have like a business casual attire but I've definitely see some guests with casual attire too. So you can dress up or down.",4.0
121,"Very rarely do I give one star but this experience fell way below my expectations from start to finish. The restaurant itself was very dark and overcrowded. The staff themselves seemed frustrated trying to get too and from each table. The greater came to the table and seemed very confused and proceeded to ask ""have y'all been treated yet?"" The salad bar had lots of taster options but seemed to be missing half of the dishes both times I went up. The drinks took 20+ minutes to get to the table. Many in our party chose to partake in the shots that the staff member brings around. We asked several times the price of the shots and we're told ""they're average price."" If you don't want to pay 15$ a shot. AVOID THEM. I'm happy I stuck to water aside from the one cucumber mint mash (it was pretty tasty).The meat was mostly rare to medium rare and after requesting something a little more cooked for a few members In our party it took almost 30 min. I think we were all quite disappointed when we saw the price of our bill in comparison to the experience. Based on the experience I had it was very overrated. Lastly, I was very sick with what felt like food poisoning following our experience.  I won't be going back.",0.0

123,I will focus on the food. The meats were cooked rare to perfection. I especially enjoyed the filet and the seasoned sirloin. The salad bar was well stocked and had fresh fruits that were excellent. I was disappointed in the way reservations were handled. In the Gas Lamp in an Diego you expect to be seated within minutes of checking in for your reservations. Unfortunately this location had no clear check in system and almost every reservation ended up waiting over an hour to be seated. Unacceptable. At the Irvine and Pasadena locations reservations were honored and seated promptly as expected.Love all you can eat and would suggest reservations before 2 PM to get lunch prices. Also prior to 2PM on weekends you get the brunch breakfast items as well as the all you can eat meats.,5.0
124,"Have been wanting to have lunch here for a bit. Went to have their regular buffet lunch, NOT the churrasqueria (No meats). Salad /soup bar. Had reservations since it was on a Friday, they got us in after like 4-5 minutes. The service was EXCELLENT! The place, decor, ambiance was EXQUISITE. Very ""RICH"" if that makes sense. No expense spared in making the spot look NICE & CLASSY!Lunch was a good deal at $15 a person, and for FRESH ready to eat food is AMAZING..The ONLY thing that I DID NOT like is their gorilla marketing selling tactics during lunch.One of the hostesses, came around the tables with little shot glasses and VERY NICELY said in a low voice, ""would you like to sample this holiday shot of ??? (Couldn't hear her).So I said ""sure"" figuring it's a free sample and if I liked it I'd order a regular size drink of it.It was ""ok"" and I left about half of it....Well, it was $15.00 by itself... which I thought was Rather high but since everything else was great, I just paid it.

But the thing that makes all the difference is good service. We had multiple people come to our table checking in on us frequently, always asking if there was any meats we were waiting on.

I repeat, The PINEAPPLE!Con: NOT vegetarian friendly, Obviously‍ but there are limited qoptionsADA: Easy/Accommodations          I know, only can be better if they improve their ""Matketplace""/salad bar to be as well stocked as other Brazilian Steakhouse locations and truthfully would only take away a 1/2 star.          No longer a small business but owned by a restaurant group,So honestly, I can not really give any negative comment about this location. The food, the atmosphere, the service, the experience, just all of it! The evening staff of Mar 30th were all absolutely a joy and would not have recommended a better team for my first time here.The Maître d's there this evening were absolutely wonderful with accommodating to our parties' needs (ADA/Vegetarian) and assisted us all along the way with recommendations, especially since one of our party is vegetarian(I know, wrong place to go!).

But.... We came today for Father's Day and I was so disappointed.  My father-in-law loves places like this and he came into town and brought him here.  We had reservations set for 7:15 and wasn't sat until a full hour later. Once inside it was insane. We were cramped into our table, that was backed into a corner- which made it so inconvenient when they were serving the meat.  Our server came only in the beginning to take/deliver out drink order and didn't see her after that.  There were a few servers that saved the day because they were amazing, and made sure to check back on us. The salad bar was a joke and insanely messy. It was picked over and food was everywhere... so we didn't get anything off of it because of how unappetizing it looked.  So again, on a regular day- it's ok.  The ambiance is nice and fun for a date night.  But i would avoid high volume holidays.",0.0

Michael the waiter was amazing I give him massive props. But once you did get the meat you wanted it was good.

146,"UPDATE: The same day I reached back out to the business via the email the manager provided, and have received zero follow up or communication back since.Upon arrival we were seated rather promptly (arrived a few minutes before our reservation time) and our server was prompt in getting our drink order, although I will caution to those ""splurging"" but still on a budget; our waitress simply asked us if we would like still or sparkling water. What wasn't mentioned is that still water comes at the price of $7.50 a bottle which we were charged twice for as she brought us another bottle when the first one ran out, which we never touched. Which, of course, we didn't find out until the end of the night when the check came.Unfortunately, the water issue was just a slight annoyance in comparison to the rest of the night. Our first three rounds of meat were all the same cut, the house special picanha. All three times, the meat was at best well done, and worst, a charcoal briquette and inedible. Our waitress was an absolute sweetheart, and the wait staff bringing the meat around were the only salvation throughout our experience. When the waitress asked how we were enjoying the meat, I nicely expressed the picanha we had so far, three times, was cooked way too long for us and not that enjoyable. She apologized and went down the list of other meats offered, to which we picked three: beef ribs, filet mignon, and ribeye. My wife asked for a lamb chop as that is her favorite meat to get here, with mint jelly. Staff brought out the ""mint jelly"" which was an orange color, when we asked our waitress what the jelly was as mint jelly is green typically, she apologized and said they had been out of mint jelly for three or four days now, and they had brought us apple jelly (spoiler alert apple jelly does NOT pair well with lamb chops). When the lamb chops arrived they were absolutely charred and black, and as my wife cut down the bone on hers, the meat just kind of sloughed off the bone and was basically charcoal.The first of my requests to come around was the filet mignon, which is one of my personal favorite cuts, second only to beef ribs. Both my wife and I took a slice and I quickly began cutting my piece as I still had the taste of overcooked picanha in my mouth. I should have been alerted by how the meat moved and ""sloshed"" around my knife as I cut there was an issue, but at this point I'm starving, the lighting is dim, and I want to get the taste of char out of my mouth so I pop a piece of filet in my mouth and start chewing. Only then do I realize as it hits my tongue and I bite into it the middle is completely cool, I swallow my bite out of sheer embarrassment as I don't want to be ""that guy"" who spits their food into a napkin but in hindsight I wish I had.I took my phone out and turned the flashlight on to get a better look at the meat with some direct light and sure enough the middle is blue and cool to the touch in both our pieces (wife had also taken and swallowed a bite simultaneously with me). This immediately turned our stomachs and I flagged one of the servers down to point out the remaining piece of filet mignon to him and ask if this looked cooked properly to which he seemed embarrassed and disgusted and said ""no it definitely isn't"" and apologized to us profusely before promising to return with meat ""that was actually cooked"".At this point our stomachs both started to gurgle and feel upset so we passed on the rest of the meat (including my glorious beef ribs) and just asked to speak to the manager as I had held the filet mignon back from being cleared to show the manager, Raffa, who was on duty what the kitchen was sending out. Our waitress said she went back and spoke with him, both about the overcooked meats, and the way undercooked meat, and that he said he would ""take care of it"". She then left and we didn't see her the rest of our time at the establishment. A new waiter came out to bring us our check which was for the full price of both meals, no comp, no discount, and the $15 for our two still waters.My wife is extremely non-confrontational and we have a standing agreement I don't make any ""scenes"" when we are out together, because I was extremely upset at how we were being treated, we had been at the restaurant less than an hour all included and had maybe 3-4 cuts of meat before the raw meat turned our stomachs, so I just paid the bill and we quickly left at her request.I can safely say in my 36 years eating out in San Diego this has been the most unprofessional and unsanitary high end experience I have ever had and I am extremely dissapointed in the brand, and management that has allowed what used to be one of our favorite date night spots to fall into such disarray.I have attached photos I took of my filet mignon to add legitimacy to my experience.",4.0

149,"I was in San Diego last week with my son to celebrate his recent promotion.  Fogo was on my son's bucket list of restaurants.  It was very crowded so we sat at the bar and had a few drinks until our table was ready.  He was so excited for the full Churrasco experience.  Unfortunately, we were both terribly disappointed:1.  We were offered the same five meats (house specialty sirloin, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, pork ribs, and sausage)2.  These meats were mostly lukewarm and not very flavorful 3.  We had at least five employees stop by asking if we needed anything.  Our reply was always the same. Yes, we have not been offered the filet, ribeye, beef ribs, double bone-in pork chop. They told us they would take care of it but the rotation of the meats did not change.  We were served beef ribs when we were getting ready to leave.  They were the last few pieces and were overcooked4.  We did not receive our sides for over 30 minutes Needless to say, we were both extremely disappointed.  We were at our table for over 75 minutes and had plans for the rest of the evening.  We did not want to spend any more time and effort trying to voice our frustration.  I had to pay with cash because our waiter never came by to take take my credit card.  In retrospect, we should have gone to a steakhouse and enjoyed a nice steak dinner for the price we paid for average sirloin and leaving still feeling hungry.  This experience put a damper on what should have been a very memorable celebration with my son.  I would not normally leave a review but this was such a disappointing experience for what Fogo charges per person.A very disappointed customer, Mike",1.0

151,"I like Fogo but this isn't a good one. They jammed 6 of us into a table in the back that was so crowded that they couldn't get to half if us.  They also start from the front of the place and go back so we got the parts nobody else wanted.  The meat wasn't cooked correctly. The waiter was some big haired dude with some phony affect.  He dumped olive oil sauce unnecessarily on two guests because he was too busy being cool and he was a trail off mumbler do badly that you couldn't understand and he was gone before you could ask.He said one person with olive oil spill gets a free dinner and that the manager knew, but of course they didn't comp the meal.  I asked a girl at the salad bar ""Is there any more pancetta?""Girl:""no""Me:""you're completely out of it?""Girl:""no""Me:""where is it?""Girl:""I'll bring it out later""The ice water was warm with no ice. Hard to get their attention and it was $65 each so not cheap.The pork rib was a dry bone of jerky.  Garlic steak so tough it couldn't be cut and most of the other meats were so rare or completely raw that you needed to chase it around the plate to eat.Repeatedly asked for barbecue sauce for 90 minutes, never got it. 10 ounce soda with a glass of melted iceThis place isn't worth the money and the discomfort of being packed in. Other Fogos aren't like this so it's just San DiegoIt was a bit of a disappointing birthday dinner.  Oh yeah, they asked about occasion and we said it was a birthday and that they gave a complimentary dessert but, also, didn't, and put the customer in the uncomfortable position if asking for what was promised.One of the desserts was really good, but again, expensive sardine can of bad service",5.0

154,"Use to be my favorite Brazilian BBQ, but it's gone way down hill. Booked online for the $39 special. You have to let them know online you're going in for the special. The special is suppose to give you around 6-7 meats. We were only served only 4. All over cooked. We were really disappointed but hey it's only $39 so we didn't complain until the bill came out. They charged us full price and insisted we got the full course. So we asked, was the $39 special for 2 meats if the full course only had 4 meats? We also let them know we had to book online specifically for the $39 special. Watch your bills we think they are trying to scam people since their business has been so bad lately. This place use to be packed but it was more than half empty. Service was good though. Btw we all got sick the next day.",5.0

156,"Went on Sunday night in attempt to enjoy a nice dinner before a hectic week and boy was I disappointed. I was sat fairly quick because I was eating alone but everything went Churrasco down hill after that. Server convinced me to get the full Churrasco Experience with continues cuts , they only brought out roughly 6/7 cuts, all the meat was overcooked or burnt. I would sit there for 10 min with no meat coming around. Ordered an old fashion and it was over priced and trash. Think my server was high and kept forgetting stuff and coming to my table! Over all terrible experience, another restaurant that compromised Quality dinning experience and service for profit. 2 old fashion and dinner $100 + I left there still hungry . I'm not going back , wouldn't recommend unless your fine throwing a $100 away on burnt filet mignon and lamb. Ill give Rei Do Gado a chance and see how that goes.",1.0

158,"This review is a little past due, but I had to make sure to share just in case anyone runs into a similar inconvenience. I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate a late Valentine's on the 18th. We had reservations @ 7pm and when we checked in a couple minutes before 7, the hostess mentioned they were about an hour behind and wouldn't be able to get us seated.. I was very disappointed - What's the point in having a reservation if you won't be able to get sat at your reserved time? To top it off, looking annoyed that people are upset for a good reason?The hostess said she could check us in and send us a text whenever our table was ready. We were really looking forward to dinner and weren't going to try looking elsewhere after having driven to DT for that specific reason so we decided to wait. We went out and had a few drinks while we were waiting and decided to come back at an hour to check how our reservation was doing. When we checked back in the hostess said it would be another 30 mins or so. We were finally seated by 8:30ish and were able to eat closer to 8:45. Took a whole hour and a half after our reservation. I'm giving it 3 stars only because the food was good, I know my boyfriend was a big fan of the filet and I enjoyed the lamb. Upset I couldn't take much advantage of it since I hate eating so late.",5.0

160,"I was pleasantly surprised with the food and service at this location. The selection for the sides aren't as lavish as other Brazilian steakhouse locations, but they had really cute and yummy pickles... The highlight of the night:: Clemepelia. Her service was impeccable. Just perfect. Clemepelia checked on us often and ensured we had the meats sent to our table, which was kind of secluded. She was so attentive and sweet! We'll definitely visit again largely because of the service (and the food too, of course)",4.0
161,"Compared to other Brazilian steak houses, this one unfortunately isn't on top of my list. The staff is very nice, it did start off a little slow when we got there, 4 people who were carving steaks passed us up. But they eventually came around and were very friendly. My only thing that I didn't like was their meat was mostly medium to well done. I personally don't like my meat that cooked but to each it's own. The sides were also all cold. Nothing I ate was out of this world. I didn't bother to go back for seconds. They only offered rice and beans, a squash soup (I think) mashed potatoes, (that they brought out when we were almost done eating, wish they brought it out at the beginning) the cheese bread and some other side (wasn't good) with plantains that was hot. Other than that, food was good. I wanted to give them a generous 3 stars but I decided to do 4 since our server saved them. He took care of us, brought us the good meat and made sure that we were good to go. Not great for how much it was. Online the menu said it was $45 for lunch but when we got our bill it was more than $150 before tip. No drinks, just water. The restaurant itself was beautiful, It was classy, I didn't see any booths from where we were. We like our booths. Easier to enjoy a meal with kids. Probably won't be going back, but I say try it once.",4.5

163,"If you've never been to a Brazilian all-you-can-eat steakhouse then this is the one to go to if you're in San Diego.  A very quick run down on how it works.  You are seated and then given a little sign that is red on one side and green on the other.Green means you are ready to chow down and you can watch as the meat trains comes steaming through your table with all varieties of meats.  They are all so delicious and seasoned beautifully.   Once you've had enough because you didn't bring the sweatpants for thay elasticity then you flip your sign around to the red side and that indicates that you no longer want anything.   You can flip it back to green when ever you're ready for seconds.It's a great spot, but beware it does get packed very quickly so be sure to make reservations if possible.  So some down sides to this place...it does get packed which at times, especially on the weekends will make the service slow and it may take a lot longer for you to get the exact cuts that you'd like to get.Another downside is how the restaurant seating is situated.  It's packed and It very much feels like depending on where you're sitting in the restaurant will depend on whether or not you get lots of meats or not.  Middle of the restaurant you're going to be okay, but as you get pushed to the back or outside you're going to be waiting a little longer than what is acceptable for this.  For the best experience please if you have a group larger than six, request the private room.  The best experience, the service is exceptional and the pricing it's very reasonable.  Anyways hope this review helps you decide on whether or not you want to give this place a shot. One last thing.....show up hungry!!!",0.0
164,"The ambiance here is better suited for large and loud groups. We heard about 5 happy birthday songs during the 2 hours that we were here and one group had 20 people. It's not as classy as I thought this would be and thankfully this wasn't on a date night, but the buffet bar was the highlight of our time here. I would say that Kaden was the best gaucho because everyone else either skipped us or avoided our little corner tucked away in the end. Kaden went above and beyond and made sure we got the filet mignon that we were waiting on all night for. He went and got it just for us and I appreciate his attention to our table. It's not a laidback experience when you have to be hyper vigilant about hunting down your gauchos. They rush through and many times skip by us even though our table stickers were green side up. For the price and ambiance, we could've had a more classy experience but this is a unique and fun configuration for groups.",4.0
165,"We took a group of 8 here for a business dinner on a Thursday evening. We had a reservation and checked in on time. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated and spent a few minutes in the bar. We were seated at the far back of the room, which was fine except for the issues below. Once seated, we all decided to do the Churrasco Experience, including the market salad bar and then the meats. Overall, the food was really good. The 3 stars is reflective of the service and probably an issue of not enough staff for how busy it was. We waiting 15 minutes for drinks, and some of the follow-up drinks took over 20 minutes to be delivered. We had to ask to start getting the meats coming to our table. Part of this I think was our location, but part was just how busy they were. Many of us have been to places like this before and have had much better service agreements, both on food and drink delivery. We also waited and waited for our check, and finally had to hunt down our server. I'm not sure if I'll go back unless changes are made to their staffing and service.",5.0

167,"I just had my third terrible experience at Fogo de Chao. I don't think it's worth the high price at all. The servers with the meat don't come around often enough, and you only get two single slices of meat in 30 minutes. I felt forgotten at my table, and the whole restaurant was complaining. I only went because my cousins wanted to try it, but they were also dissatisfied and left hungry. The salad bar was really dirty, and the rice and beans were empty every time I tried to get some. When I asked the waiter for rice, she said they'd refill it soon. Fogo de Chao is starting to feel like a soup kitchen for the hungry and not an actual Brazilian steakhouse. I suggest going elsewhere if you're looking for a nice dinner with amazing food.",4.0

Very tasty and I definitely felt my drink. Then it was on to our table and food. We waited a little while for the servers to come our way with the different choices of meat, but once they came, they didn't stop! I really loved the picanha, bone -in ribeye, top sirloin, and steak. And your meal also comes with sides like the cheese bread (which i couldn't get enough of), crispy polenta, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas. The servers were nice, friendly, and attentive.

171,"We love this chain of Brazilian steakhouses in general, having been to various locations around the country and regularly going to the one near our house.  This location however was a disaster.  We arrived on cold night and were told to wait outside, despite the fact we were sitting on the entry bench. When I said we would like to stay inside since our daughter was cold, she said my kid could stay but me and my wife had to wait outside.  Our daughter is three.  The entry area was apparently reserved for strollers to be parked while people ate.  Once sat, the restaurant was extremely overcrowded.  They had jammed tables everywhere and there was no room to walk to the buffet.  The meats came out quickly, but the selection was very limited compared to what we are used to (although it could be that many of the meats just never got to us in the back corner).  Our favorite is the sausage and in an hour and a half we never got any (though the table next to us did after we finished eating).  The meats we did get were overcooked and jerky like.  Not the wonderful medium rare we are used to at the other locations.  Finally, our waiter was terrible (not the meat servers, they were great).  He paid all his attention to the larger parties and we never got a chance to order a second drink or to get more cheese bread.  We sat for 20 minutes after we finished eating and he never came by.  Finally a different waiter said he would bring us our check.  That never happened either and eventually our waiter did reappear.  He looked confused when I asked for our check (admittedly with a little annoyance in my voice at this point).  Our plates had been cleared 15 minutes earlier and we had been done with our drinks for an hour (again with no opportunity to order another).  On our way out, the entry was empty (no strollers), but there were 50ish people waiting outside.  Of course those people might have been sat earlier if the waiters were clearing out tables instead of people waiting 35 minutes to pay. Do not go to this location, but the others are definitely worth it.",5.0

174,"For the past two decades almost, Fogo has been my favorite restaurant of all time. (Shout out to Houston's and Bacchanal in Vegas). So it hurts me to even post this. I just hope it will help them improve. The area around Fogo's is raggedy. Not there fault at all that the Gaslamp is trash these days, the sidewalks reeking of feces and urine. But Fogo's has allowed the deplorableness surrounding the building to seep in; the place looks weathered and dated even though I remember the B&N bookstore it used to be, so it's not that old. And it's dirty. The furniture and fixtures could use a good old-fashioned power wash. I went at lunch time and decided to call my order in ahead of my arrival. Homegirl at the front didn't know the menu. At all. Then when I went up to the bar, the bartender wasn't nice or friendly. Seemed like he wanted to be anywhere else. Even though I called my order in, I still had to wait 20 mins to get my food. They messed up my order of the HH hummus and had to redo it. Finally, my HH beef rib plate was cold, like it had been sitting out for some time. And y'all know how bad a fatty beef rib is when it's not hot.",2.0
175,"Fogo is hands-down my favorite restaurant of all time. Houston's is second. Honorable mentions to CPK, City Taco, and Antonelli's Deli. I always go w/ friends and fam, but the wife was outta town and I had a coupon for $25 off lunch. So I went alone on a Sunday at lunch. The restaurant, which is probably a third the size of the one in Beverly Hills, was maybe 65% full. So for $18, I made 3-4 strong trips to the produce bar. My server was very friendly and provided me w/ more mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and sweet plantains than I could eat in 3 sittings. And the gauchos did the rest; bringing different cuts and varieties of meat until ya boy was forced to flip the disc over to the red side. No more!! I could've almost spent as much at Mickey D's. Best value ever, imo. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE order the fried cheese w/ honey drizzle. They don't bring it out so you have to request it.

The gauchos who came out to serve us the unlimited portions of grilled meat, (a bit fewer selections than at dinner), just kept coming until we were forced to flip our red light/green light discs! The meat does run salty, though I usually cut it some with the GF cheese balls and produce from their salad bar. LOVE the artichoke hearts-so fresh! They also gave us a free dessert for our celebration. We chose the key lime cheesecake. OMG! It's worth about $12 on the menu. It was our second time at this location, (been to the BH location 3 times), and we would return. Sign up for their e-newsletter to get some great lunch and dinner discounts.",5.0

180,"Actually $64 for the churrasco all you can eat tableside carved meat experience is quite worth it, but I thought my dining experience was overall ok. If you're driving by on a weekend evening, chances are that you'll see hoards of people overflowing out of the doorway and crowding around the sidewalk of 6th and G. We had a reservation so we weaved past the crowd to enter and talk to the hostesses at the stand. Inside was super muggy smelling and pretty uncomfortable. Despite checking in and having a reservation, we were asked to wait a bit for them to get our table ready. So we headed into the bar area and I got a Fogo caipirinha. This helped tremendously, refreshing from the muddled lime with sweetness from the cane sugar, a great simple and delicious cocktail. We our table was called we were lead back behind the curtain to the dining area. Inside the dining area was just as muggy and musty smelling as the lobby area. We dodged tables and people to get to our table. Looks like they tried to cram as many tables as they could all over the place. I found it challenging to get the the salad bar in the center and even more so with a plate of items, trying not to run into anyone or drop my plate. It's impressive that the staff can maneuver around with the tableside served meat. My favorite cuts might have been the top sirloin, lamb picanha, and pork sausage. It was a lot of food and a lot of meat. I found it refreshing to get several slices of pineapple to help with the digestion. While food generally was good and the value for all you can eat also good, I just found the crowdedness and the musty smell in the restaurant distracting to the overall experience.",5.0

184,"FogoMy advice to this restaurant: DON'T open up tables if you can't ensure ALL seated can experience the full Churrasco experience!Ours turned out to be NOT a continuous tableside service of signature cuts of fire roasted meat. First of all, having a dinner reservation for 5 meant nothing at all as, even as they had already pushed it to 15 minutes later, we had to wait a good 30 minutes more to get seated. The hostess led us to a table way in the very back corner of an empty interior section. We never really knew who our server was as each one that came over was different. There were no introductions or instructions. We were left to figure things out. The only reason we knew to head over to the market bar is because one person in our party had been here once before. Sure we were given water to drink and one refill but after that, bone dry. No offer for other types of drinks and no menu to choose from. Sure, we got the sauces and the obligatory warm pao, polenta, mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas but to eat with what protein??? The ones that were brought to us only in the beginning?The ones that never made it to our back table? Boy, did we have our  coasters on green for a long time while we longingly waited for those skewers of meat to make it to our table but no, the once empty interior dining filled up fast and those meats never made it to our table. We literally waited 20 - 30 minutes nibbling on sides from the passable salad bar when we should have been feasting on Brazilian meats. For the exorbitant dinner price, I would say all we each got was a small saucer of meat samples. Out of the 13 meats listed on their website, we got to try 4 of them at the most. Not worth $66.50 per person. Not even close. We tried to flag down some servers to get them to come to our table. We were able to get two of them (skewers devoid of meat, of course) and we asked them to please come back and give us some meat and both said yes ""We got you"" but they never came back. A staffer, finally, did come around to ask how everything was and we told her our honest impressions. It looked like she took notes of our concerns and said she'd be sending servers over. That's when we found out we didn't have a dedicated server and they all shared server duties. What a nightmare for coordination. It's no wonder that we had a long wait to get the check and another long wait for someone to get our payment. Then, instead of taking our cards, another server brought us another check. (See the nightmarish scenario in this?) Did we get meats after complaining? While waiting for the check situation to be resolved, a couple of meat servers did come around but with the same meats we've already tried so there was no novelty in that and no interest left in us. We didn't even have the energy to ask for water refills for our bone dry cups. We had given up at this point. It was time to go. Given that it's a busy time and day, what with it being a Saturday and the day right before Mother's Day but that should not be a detraction. You're in this business and in this prime location. You should thrive during times like this. Lastly, the bathrooms are a mess. No toilet paper. No trash can in the handicapped stall. Trash strewn everywhere. Disgusting.",5.0

194,"First time at this restaurant and I would never come back. Had a 6pm reservation and when we sat down, we only saw chicken and sausage for a whole hour. We asked at least 3 servers if other meats were coming. All said yes, but we waited another 20 minutes to be served other meat options. Most of their staff are busy offering shots and appetizers instead of providing enough staff to actually serve the meats. I have eaten at Texas de Brazil and the service is much more top tier. Meats were constantly being served without having to wait too long in between. This restaurant was slow to refill the sides such as the mashed potatoes and cheese breads. Asked for more than one slice of top sirloin from one of the servers and he refused. Said, he needs to serve the others first. I've never even heard of such a thing. It's an all you can eat restaurant but they can't give more than one slice of meat at a time?!? This was never an issue at other Brazilian steak houses. Bottom line, we would never go back nor would I recommended this place to anyone. Waste of money and time.",1.0

The package I chose included choice of 4 types of proteins I had the bacon wrapped chicken, the top sirloin and picanha also inclsides, salads, and sauces and they even gave us some chafing warming trays to keep the food hot. Will definitely use their catering service again! Highly recommend!!",1.0
197,"I like to think of myself as a steak fanatic. I have loved steak since I was a baby. So I was very excited to finally be coming here. I sat down and was given a small coin to signal that I wanted to be served steak. Wonderful!!! The steak was well seasoned and juicy,steaming hot, freshly cooked wonderfulness! The service was beyond great, the drinks were fabulous, the salad bar was...there was a Giant salad bar in the middle of a fancy restaurant... It's kind of awkward. I mean it's in the middle of the room..Judging you ""Hi I'm here to remind you that you should eat some salad with all the meat and carbs you're devouring"" it says. So I cave and get a small plate of salad. Then come the little golden muffins that taste like buttery clouds, the little plates of mashed potatoes,some plantains and I tasted each to acknowledge their presence at our table.But after a few pieces of my delicious fillet I had to reluctantly turn over my steak coin because I was so full! And very very sad because I filled up on those little muffins.I'm still sad that I couldn't eat more fillet because it was soooo goooooddd!!!!So my tips to anyone going:*Skip the carbs (little glorious muffins) that are loaded with butter because you will get full and not have enough room for the fillet.*Skip the skirt steak, and the bacon wrapped chicken. Just get the fillet and lamb and more fillet and wine or caphirinas. If it doesn't show up, Ask for the fillet.its worth it!*Enjoy your time at this magical steak palace land! It will be just as you dreamt it but better!",5.0

201,"So quality of food, ok.  It was all you can eat, so it was all you can eat quality and that's fine, that's what I paid for.Costumer service.  Some areas fell short but I saw the staff trying real hard.  I assume it was because we went there on Friday night, the busiest time of all.  I was angry about 20 mine wait at the front that ended up being 1 h 30 min though.  That needs to get fixed.I would give 5 stars though if it were not for that one table on the left side of the kitchen entrance?  There is a row of tables, walk passage, 2 seater table and the wall.  And the whole walking passage way turned into a narrow strait where two people walking toward each other has to cooperate with one another if they were to go to the other side.  In the US Navy, we called that the choking point because of the strategic importance in a warfare.  But I think the word choice is correct because I wanna choke the crap out of whoever decided to put the 2 seater table there.  Are you kidding me?",4.0

206,"I went on NYE with a group of friends and the place was packed. I would imagine you will need a reservation just for a normal night. We were seated quickly but service wasn't too great. I could tell a bunch of new hires were working, which is understandable. With every new hire there's learning curves which causes delays. We ended up spending about 3 hours there not by choice. The beef is really good, well seasoned and you can get the top cuts as much as you please. They're also really good about getting your preferred temperature. The chicken wrapped in bacon was overly salty and I wouldn't recommend. The bang for your buck is in the beef. Drinks were great and the salad bar was delicious with great options.Grilled pineapple and the molten chocolate cake were a nice way to end the meal.",4.0

208,"SO disappointed. Granted we ordered via Uber, but the problems came from the restaurant. Our order was totally screwed up. We ordered a two protein meal with Caesar salad and sautéed asparagus. We got a double portion of beef instead of picahna and lamb. We got the potato salad and black beans & rice. The chimichurri sauce was missing. The sautéed asparagus was grilled and since the were super-skinny stalks, the were desiccated.   So did Uber mess up?  Unlikely--the  bag had the correct details attached to it. I have to assume the restaurant staff package up the food and fill the labeled bags.  This is especially sad since we were ordering a special meal for someone just out of surgery.  We had dined in a few years back, but hadn't been back due to the hassle associated with the Gaslamp location.",4.0

210,Came here during lunch for the $15 market table buffet and added the 8-10oz picanha for $10. Been craving souplantations salad bar and this is the closest thing to it. The cheese bread and maple bacon are highly addictive. When ordering a side of meat they carve table side and ask if you want your 8-10oz all at once or brought out in smaller portions. Reservations recommended,5.0
211,"I've been here a handful of times but last night was absolutely unacceptable. We went on Veterans Day since they had a 50% off meal for service members. We knew it would be crowded considering it's a Friday night plus this, so we made reservations online for 7:30. It was so crowded that people were getting seated 1.5-2hrs after their reserved times. People were getting pissed of the lack of honesty and poor planning. Not until later in the night were they telling people that the wait with reservation would be around 45min, which was complete bullshit even then since people have been waiting hours. What pissed me off the most is when my husband went up to ask about the wait and said we've been waiting almost 2 hours at the at point the hostess acted all shocked about the situation. Don't play that oblivious stupid card with me. It's absolutely insulting. Even after getting seated the meat selection was very small. Only about 4 of the options were rotating. Service was so bad you had to ask multiple times for something as simple as water. I get that it was busy but this was something that should've been known and planned for considering it's a holiday, Friday night, and you have a special going on. I don't understand the point of a reservation system if you aren't going to honor it.",1.0

The restaurant was not busy at all, but it seemed like they were still having people wait, so I'd recommended having a reservation like we did. The prices were absolutely fair. I'm a vegetarian, so I got the cauliflower steak and had unlimited access to the salad bar. I was not wowed by the salad bar at all. It was good, but it could've been better. And one of my sides that came with my entree came straight from the salad bar. My boyfriend enjoyed getting to try all the meats that were brought to us throughout our meal. We told waiters it was our anniversary and they let us pick a complimentary desert! So sweet! Shoutout to our waiter Crystal! Great customer service and extremely attentive.",1.0
214,"I have been to Fogo's all over the country and this one has not met expectations in terms of service. I didn't need a reservation for brunch on a Sunday. I was eating by myself and just wanted the Market Table. They at least brought me a glass of water, but no one ever asked me for my drink order so I didn't order one. They brought one order of bread but no potatoes or fried banana. They never asked if I wanted more. I looked around and other tables had the potatoes and bananas side dish. Someone came around with fried cheese and honey and never offered it to me. One of the servers, poor girl, had a very dirty looking shirt. The Market Table itself was fine. Hence, the two stars.

I ordered an old fashioned and it took over 30 minutes to arrive at the table. No filet mignon, despite me asking the waiter several times. This experience, service, and food are terrible. I rarely write a bad review, I'm typically happy to just pay and not patron the business again, but this was one of the worst experiences and service I've had.

This Fogo branch is huge and cozy with attentive and polite staff on top of all types of brazilian barbeque known to man. My all time favorite is lamp chops. An eat all you can semi formal dining experience for a protein load up. Location couldn't be more perfect in this part of town. Where else but in the middle of the famous Gas Lamp District. Parking is a challenge on weekends and holidays. Street parking is virtually impossible so the best alternative are public parking areas which are usually walking distance from the restobars. The place closes late but you might want to reserve a table here as it can easily get crowded esp on weekends. This one is hands down the best brazilian barbeque in the US.",5.0

There is no way this 4-5 star restaurant should have customers with plates stacked up as if they're in the kitchen. A manager had to come and get the plates after I waved him down. The whole night we had to flag down someone for any help. This was due to the multiple large parties that received more attention. Management should've done a better job managing the floor so that EVERYONE is receiving service. I mean that's what we're paying for, right?! Let's make David the manager, as he was doing his very best to attend to my family.",5.0

I've always thought of the place as high end and luxurious because of how fancy it is and clean. Unfortunately this last trip on Saturday was a disaster. It was after the Padres game and I had a reservation at 9pm. We didn't get our table until 9:35. The team looked absolutely swamped, and I get it, there were big parties and a bunch of people. Perhaps it was the short staff that ruined the experience but I thought it could have been handled better. The salad bar was messy, there were no plates, I had 2 servers disappear on me and didn't even have a designated person to help our table. We ran out of water and had to wait 24 mins because no one would come up. Bathrooms were not taken care of: floors were messy, no more paper towels/soap, it was disgusting! Some of the food servers were attending to the bigger parties and we were left hungry until after closing. Mike and David both saved the day. These guys are meat servers and they made sure we recovered from our bad experience. The sad thing was not even the supervisors/managers were helpful when we clearly had a bad time. Anyways I still recommend the Parmesan Pork Chop, Beef Rib and Picanha Sirloin. I hope in my next visits the standards are met and the experience is better.",4.0

231,"Hands down my all time favorite place to go eat. I'm a meat eater and my girlfriend knows that. She surprised me by taking me to Fogo de Chão on my birthday. We had wine, a healthy yet exotic buffet selection, dessert and most importantly MEAT! Short: All you can eat meat, Id rather go here for steak than any other steakhouse because of the variety and atmosphere. Long: you start off at the buffet, full of choices from imported goods all around the world. Sample everything! (But just nibbles, don't waste food and don't get full too fast) You may also want to choose a wine selection to sip on during your dinner. After that you watch as servers (who also cook their meats) walk around with juicy, tender, delicious pieces of meat to share with everyone. YES PLEASE! The variety is amazing. I know some people think Filet Mignon and Rib Eye is a must, but they're not my top 3. I recommend: Picanha the house special, Parmesan Pork Lion, Leg of Lamb, Garlic Sirloin and surprisingly the chicken. You can't go wrong with any of them. All these meats are well prepared, seasoned and cooked. I don't recommend medium rare because you may have a bad night. Get medium and just get one slice or a tiny cut to sample (unless you know what you like). Pace yourself and enjoy your glorious dinner. I'm a regular now but whenever I go here I literally feel on top of the world. I'm sat across my beautiful girlfriend and good company, I feel like a prestigious man and I get to enjoy the best food.",3.0

I've been here before the and the meat selection is delicious, along with the bread and the salad bar. We went around 3 pm and it wasn't crowded. I'm giving a four star because I ordered tea in the beginning when I sat down and I didn't get it, which is fine I get it it's something small to forget but because the waiters don't really come around because it's basically ayce and what do I really need a waiter for if the food is readily available to me or being carried around on sticks haha but it was difficult to eventually get my waiter. I got my tea but I think maybe they can walk around more? Idk. Another reason why I gave 4 stars was because I've been here before and I didn't feel like this happened to me before but I feel like I would flag down someone with meat ready to be carved and not be offered it? Even though it was part of the restaurant week and I had my green card showing I was a ""go"" for meat. Overall, coming back again and it was still really great!",5.0

There were meat listed on their menu that was not served or the servers we're choosing the tables and ignoring us.. Normally you can request for meats but this time even if requested it never came.It was a disappointing experience. To me Fogo lost it's fine dinning status that day.

Next, the salad bar is open for you to go as many time as you like. Cold pastas, cheeses, salami, Salads, soups,  and more.  Next wait for servers to come around with different cooked meats that they shave off and you get to eat.

268,"Was very excited to come back to this restaurant after going about 10 years ago on the east coast. This experience is a 180 from the one I had last. 1 star is for ambiance and the fact we didn't have to wait too long to sit for our reservation despite the place being super busy on a Saturday night. Firstly, the server took our wine bottle order only to come back with the wrong bottle and then to let us know after 10 minutes the bottle we did order was not available. Second, the buffet was disappointing. Little things, like no bowls for soup the entire night, no beans, and no cut prosciutto added to our frustrations. The most disappointing part of the dinner was the fact that we didn't even experience all the options meat. We witnessed a number of times a server with beef going to the tables before us who would finish it off, then not returning. We were offered chicken and pineapple several times and had to ask multiple times (I think 4 in total) for cuts like lamb and sirloin. The servers did however continue to bring bread, bananas, fried cheese, and mashed potatoes, not the meat we kept requesting. Of the 6 beef items we kept requesting, we only received 2. Will not be returning to the San Diego location.",5.0

271,"I've been to Fogo on many occasions, my latest visit was on a Friday and it was by far the worst experience I had. Fogo is no longer the somewhat intimate experience that it use to be, the have crammed so many tables in such a small space that the servers can barely make it through. It was a busy Friday and although this place has been in business for quite some time they seemed to be unable to keep up with the demand. Within the first hour and a half of being seated we saw 2 of the 14 meats. Within the following hour we saw 1 new meat and then the Pichana a second time. It was loud enough you could hardly hear the other side of your table. It came to a point where we weren't enjoying our dinner anymore and decided to leave, unsatisfied, disappointed, and unfortunately still hungry.    As family with Brazilian roots this was a let down. It's seems they are overselling the meal and then under delivering now.",2.0
272,Enjoyed the experience. Service improved a lot relative to 4-5 months ago.Salad buffet is appealing but needs a personal touch and local providers.. it tastes like hotel food unfortunately.Meat journey is positive but average meat quality.

285,"Congrats! My Personal Top TEN.......worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant.Beginning to end, this was awful. I considered walking out a few times. But we were trapped between going to a fast place for food or waiting again at another establishment to celebrate our special occasion. anyway, let's go.We called for a res reservation earlier that day. They said 8pm was booked so we left it up to the host to tell us when it will be available. Oddly she said 7:45. So we took the reservation. Red flag 1 We arrived 15 minutes early. Just like a responsible and respectful customer would do. They confirmed our arrival and asked us to shortly wait. 30 minutes go by and we ask what our eta is. Our host said ""40 minutes"" so I asked but we have a reservation, what was the reservation for? She replied while signaling around the room, ""everyone here has a reservation"". She emotionlessly stares at me, unapologetic and remorseless. Red flag 2 We frustratingly wait an additional 45 minutes. Everyone around is upset. Everyone is hungry. Everyone is tired. Everyone that was once there prior to us has been sat so we decided to ask again. As we approach , upset customers are fighting for the attention of the hosts. We get ignored as she accepts the questions of more aggressive and aggravated people waiting. She is now arguing with them. The other hosts are running around, trying to figure out the chaos. The original host steps off to help a different guest so an angry customer asks for that host's name in which the answer was ""I don't know her name, it's my first day too"".... Red flag 3 We finally get sat. No one touches our table for about 15 minutes. Finally get are able to order and begin eating of some sort. Buffet bar is disheveled, charcuterie is dry, cold foods are a bit warm... It's a TCS nightmare. Red flag 4 Yay, we are finally eating something. Someone comes by with sausage.... Only to realize that we were never give tongs or the red/green card. Not a big issue obviously but also table wasn't properly set. Dirty napkins still under our table and chairs, food was at our feet from previous diners. Gross..... Red flag 5 After the first dude came through with a slice of sausage, it took almost 20 minutes for someone to come by with another meat option. Which we finally were able to get a flow happening . But after the 3rd person.... We were not visited by any  churrasco person any more.  Our server was no longer anywhere to be found. It was like half the staff went on break. At this time, we walk by the bar and two of the three hosts (not the rudely emotionless one) ceoss each other's paths to high five each other in celebration. Cute. Probably because they finally sat all the tables they had waiting in frustration. Maybe because they felt good in resolving a problem they created. Maybe because their first day in the workforce felt like they were on the stupid TV Show The Bear. Normally I would think the high five was adorable, but I'm far gone at this point. With our server still no where to be found, food was no longer arriving to the table; I was pissed. Service was arriving at the tables around us, I had to get up twice to get pitchers of water to serve ourselves, and now we are getting full off of water and potentially dangerous salad bar items. We just wanted our check. But still server was no where. We needed to ask another server which magically took longer than needed. All these frustrations, let's just make that the last Red flag This place needs a competent manager, I'm sure they have one (or more) for actual structure and guidance.... I'm sure this chain has its SOPs.... I'm sure that corporate would be unhappy at this level of unprofessionalism and service. Good luck, I won't be back. I hope something is learned from this.",4.0

296,I wish I had a better experience at fogo. For now I wouldn't say this is the best tasting Brazilian steak house in SD. The only reason I wouldn't give this place a 3 star because the staff was really attentive and the decor inside was wonderful. My only complaint was about the meat rotation. It seemed like we were getting the lower end meats and they kept bringing the same meats. The filet never came out and we specifically had to ask for it. We later received the filet but 30 mins after we started eating. You get free desert if it's someone's b day!!!,5.0

298,"Brought my family back in for a birthday celebration after having such a great experience the last time and was SO disappointed. We have always had a good experience so we made sure to hype it up to all of our guests but unfortunately today did not live up to all of the great things we said. We were pretty central so I assumed we'd get good meat selections and great service but we did not. We had to request almost all of the meats due to the only having the same two come around every time. We had to request the Rib Eye 3 times from 3 people before it finally came out and it was unfortunately SO raw even the carver decided to take it back then never came back with it. Most of our thicker cuts were unfortunately almost completely raw and I'm usually a rare-med rare person but the cuts were almostInedible. We ordered our second round of drinks during the middle of our dinner and didn't receive them until we were ready to pay out. A lot of little things that made it not the best experience, but really could have just caught them on a rough day.",5.0

300,"We have been to this Fogo many times, but the last few times, we've had poor experiences. We went back today bc we had family in town from Texas and we were celebrating a birthday. We are really glad we went, still some issues to address, but overall I would still give it a 5-star review for server attentiveness, the management, and effort they put forth. Daasha was amazing! Funny and awesome! Connected with our little baby girl and made her laugh several times as did the manager who also had a 16-month old at home. We had an early reservation and we're a little disappointed that the meats weren't coming by as fast and didn't seem to have all the meats choices until the end of our experience, but our meat requests would come after we asked for them. Most of meats came out were a little over cooked until we requested our medium-rare and then after that all came out perfect. So overall 5-stars for effort and service, 4-stars for quality of food, 3-stars for the changing table being out of order, but again 5-stars to the male server who checked in the mens room to see if there was a changing table in there! Baby girl would rate everything 5 -stars....especially the cheese bread!",5.0

Took advantage of the all day Happy Hour pricing on drinks. The cucumber smash was a hit as was the $4 Xingu beer.Some of the meats were just okay. A bit of a disappointment because I've been to other locations and everything was amazing. The lamb, however, was amazing. I skipped on the salad bar. Fir me, Fogo is all about the meat.

I've been to a couple other Brazilian Steakhouses before as well as this location. However, the last time I visited here, they only served outside due to the Covid Pandemic. Today, we dined inside and had the full Churassco Experience. We were seated in the main dining room a few tables away from the market/ salad buffet for their brunch service. We were immediately greeted as we sat down by Jacob, our server. Aside from the meat servers, there appeared to be a small team serving us. Great service!I was amazed at the spread at the cold bar. Great choice of meats, cheeses, salads and grilled/ marinated veggies. My plate was piled high with fresh and healthy goodness. Along with the cold buffet, we indulged in the made to order omelets. Place your order with the chef and they'll deliver to your table so no waiting to dive into the feast. Yesenia was preparing omelettes on our visit. She delivered a tasty treat within minutes. Then, the meats started to arrive. Their servers bring a freshly grilled meat to your table side and carve until your heart's content. Top sirloin, lamb chops, bacon wrapped filet mignon, beef ribs, flank steak and the Brazilian specialty Picanha are a few of which I tried.  Make sure to ask your server about the sauces and have them with various bites to enhance your experience. I requested the Brazilian hot sauce, horse radish and chimichurri sauces. Each had its own unique flavor and added a twist to the meat. Guests are also brought cheese bread, polenta sticks and mashed potatoes. Be sure not to fill yourself on these delightful sides, which is easy to do. At the end of the meal, you'll be offered a dessert menu. We politely declined as we needed to be rolled out to the curb after eating so much. Oh, and don't forget the pineapple coming from the kitchen. It's a nice sweet treat to end the meal. Keep on Yelp'n!",4.0

335,"Was not worth the money spent on this place even for brunch which is when we visited. Our first visit for our anniversary and the service and selection was subpar. Ambiance was nice besides the elevator music playing. The hostess was really friendly. We didn't expect things to go downhill after being seated. Our server comes up and she's wearing a medical mask around her chin the entire time we were there. We didn't understand the point of that; It's on or off? She explains how everything works and gave us the impression there would be a wide selection of protein circulating. We proceeded to the area where you helped yourself to sides. There were no labels on anything so you really didn't know what you were getting, which later ended up being thrown out once you tasted what the dish was. Selection was mediocre but I didn't come for the sides, I came for the meat. Initially, it looked somewhat promising because the moment we turn our green indicators on, the carvers showed up. The proteins were mostly dry and overcooked. What we mostly got were sirloins. We saw the same cut of beef for 3 rounds. There was hardly a variety and after those initial stops, the carvers disappeared. If I was to count, I would say we saw maybe 8 different cuts/proteins? All of which seemed to be cheaper cuts, overcooked, dry, and grainy. If you enjoy beef jerky, this is your spot. The highlight of our meal was the caramelized bananas they served. We had to ask for more since we needed something to make up for what we were about to pay. I ordered a soda and they also charge for refills. Sadly, we will not be returning to this restaurant.",5.0

337,"The service from Jose the Brazilian gentleman,  David and Javier, was exelent, Aline the customer service coordinator, was also exceptional, she was very attentive to my concerns. But I got to say that there was one lady that was serving our table, should not be in the business,  she was rude, first she ignored me when I asked her if they had brazilian sausage, she was offended for no reason  and told me to wait , like I was starving or something. I'm from Brasil born and raised, this place has the concept of brasilian stake houses, but is nothing like in Brasil...I would not go back there...the man who saved the night,, was definitely  Jose, he found out that I was from Brasil, and was so proactive about  making my first experience there, a nice one, I kind of wana to walk out of there...Aline knows about the mistreatment of the waitress from Turkey,  I found out where she is from...like I said she does not belong in the business.First and last experience there...I am not but hurt, just very disappointed,  for the fact that I was a paying customer and should not be mistreated for asking a question, be ignored talked  like I was her dog doing something wrong...by the way, was my birthday.

342,"Came here with my parents for the first time to celebrate my birthday and overall it was an okay experience, I wouldn't say it was anything spectacular. I made a dinner reservation in advance and we were seated immediately for a party of 3 which was nice. The restaurant is dimly lit which is part of the ambiance. There's a bar called the ""market table"" full of different sides such as cold cut meats, salad, and cheeses which is included in the dinner option at $65 a person. I ordered a strawberry hibiscus caipirinha cocktail and since it was happy hour, the cocktail was $9. My favorite thing here was the cheesy bread haha. The meats were okay, but since I prefer most of my meats well done, most of their options are served medium rare to rare. If you prefer your meats well done, expect to wait 30 minutes or more to be served the well done options since they are quite limited except for the sausage, pork, and chicken. Also, there are red and green cards on your table to indicate to the servers whether you would want some more meat or not. I think service was a bit slow since it was a Friday evening dinner, but the servers were friendly. Although I didn't really love the meat here, the staff was nice and I got a complimentary tres leches cake slice birthday dessert. In terms of finding parking here in Downtown San Diego, there is valet and there are also different parking garages for you to choose from but you have to pay.",3.0

349,Brunch reservation for a Saturday. We didnt wait long to be seated and waitress explained how it all worked. We had visited  Foca de Chao in the Atlanta area so we were excited to compare.

353,"I wanted to take my nephews out who graduated high school to a nice dinner. Food tonight was as amazing as any other FDC I've been to. The sad part was the service was extremely disappointing. What would typically be an 1.5 hr meal at most, turned into an exhausting 2.5 dinner. Sitting for 2 hours and being asked if we needed anything, refilling our water, ordering an alcoholic beverage a total of 4 times... well do the basic math (Once every 30 minutes). Then what topped it off and made me ask for the manager was the 3rd person I asked for our check, took 15 minutes to bring the check and then once i got the alert my card was charged, took another 12 minutes to get it back!!!!Speaking to the manager, I explained our waiter must had been busy because I saw him running around but probably could use more help on Fridays AND ON COMIC-CON WEEKEND IN SD.... he said ""it wasn't busy and he apologized for the poor service"" There's a disconnect between the leadership and workers here and hopefully it improves. I didn't ask for anything, but hopefully as a Manager myself in an Aerospace company, they can take this as a learning lesson and improve. Needless to say, I will never be back to this FDC again.",1.0

357,"We usually love Fogo. Been to serveral (even this one many years ago) the experience is usually very high end, with excellent service and amazing food. This was not the case this week. There seemed to be a short staff issue. There were only 2 people bringing meats around, which they would run out and have to go back and get more of the same meat. So this left a lot of time waiting. Also most of the meat was over cooked or really fatty. I've never had that issue before. Our server basically ignored us. She could see we needed our check but choose to clear off another table (no bus person) and go take it to the back. She never came back out so we found an assistant manager to get our check. Then after I paid I asked to speak to a manager (I wanted to pay first so they didn't think I was just complaining to get a discount) but the manager never came!! So we left. At $45 a person for lunch this was NOT worth it. We have one opening in Huntington Beach soon and now I'm not as excited about it as I was. Side note the place was freezing - we had to keep our jackets on.",5.0

364,"What a messy situation. We arrived at Fogo De Chão for a company party with a reservation set at 7:30. They asked us to get there 15min prior and our entire party was there by 7:09. To say the hostess stand and lobby was a mess is almost an understatement. We waited in a jam packed lobby until 9:30 and were finally sat after we initiated a heated conversation with the manager. Our conversation detailed our observations of them seating bigger groups with a later reservation before us... their continuing to seat 4 tops and saying they were unable to accommodate us. Amongst other issues, the manager adamantly told us that reservations don't matter since they ""can't force people to get up from their seats."" It would've been nice to have at least a warning rather than be ignored completely. After we threatened to leave, the manager got his act together and put two 4 top tables together and finally got us in.Once we got in, it was chaos. Between being bombarded as soon as we sat by the servers and trying to navigate away from the table to the salad bar... it was insanely chaotic. Several variations of meat were well done, dry, and cold. It was upsetting to have waited that long and experience such a minuscule representation of what we've experienced in the past. The salad bar was a mess with the exception of the cheese bar. Employees held up the salad bar line with their attempts at trying to ""reorganize"" the display, which in most cases made it more messy. The decent things: the cheese bar was great but the cheese was a little warm which made it kind of a weird texture. The corn side was great but tasted heavily of Mayo. Chicken Mike made our experience great and is the only reason this place deserves more than one star. He did a ton of work to try and uplift our group and keep us happy. I greatly appreciate the employee he is and if we ever decide to come back - it's solely because we enjoy his presence and entertainment. He deserves the recognition. Thank you so much Mike! We received the chocolate brigadeiro as a dessert - which was like a cross between a chocolate flan and chocolate mousse. It was heavenly and almost made us forget the nightmare of an experience that was the inside lobby. Overall, considering I've been here before... I'm extremely disappointed by the handling of the reservation, how they treated people in the lobby, the lack of honesty and transparency, and the quality of meat from some servers were all disappointing. It's no secret that Chicken Mike carries this establishment and is one of the main reasons this restaurant is patronized. Mike, thank you for making our experience. Management, honestly... shame on you all.",5.0

Been here for at least five times now, my first time was back in Seattle, and been in love with this place ever since! As soon as you walk in, you're greeted by the staff and take you to your table. I usually make reservations so my seat is secured! They get super busy. Even with reservations sometimes, the wait for you table can be long. So preferably, make a reservation no matter what. Food:Everytime I come here, I always do the Churrasco Experience. It's pretty much an AYCE meat! This includes a massive salad/appetizer bar! On your table, there is a card with a colors red & green. Green means ""Give me my meats!"" And red means ""stop"" or ""pause, I need to digest my food real quick."" There are staff walking around with cuts of meats fresh from the grill, and they stop at your table if your card is green, obvi they won't if you have your card turned red. My  favorites are Lamb Chops (have to order),  Filet Mignon, Beef Ribs (have to order), Bottom Sirloin, Top Sirloin!! On top of this experience, you can also add on some dry aged Tomahawk Steak & Wagyu NY Strip & Ribeye for additional price! Now, if you don't want the Experience, they also have the Market Table Food & Entrées.

Meats coming by were far n few n d place was packed. Furthermore, d same type of meat keeps passing by.  Even when servers can see there's nothing on your plate, they would not even ask to see if they can bring anything you need. But even when they do n say they'll place an order for d type of meat you requested? It never comes n the server will conveniently walk around/avoid/ignore yr table so they  can just pretend nothing was requested.  Frustrating to hv dinner like this.  Place was super noisy and busy.

We reallly enjoyed the wagyu ancho and then came back for the churrasco experience.Parking is as expected for being DTSD, so make sure to plan accordingly when you make a reservation- we were about 10 minutes late and they were very kind and understanding!We stuck to the meats and the meats only, every cut we tried had a good flavor and was tender. The bananas or plantains were one of my favorites, along with those fluffy bread balls, the pineapple with cinnamon (so simple and so good!) and the passion fruit mousse dessert! We also tried the caramel brûlée, chocolate molten cake, and their tres leches cake which also had great flavors, were quite rich, and with generous portions. We also had an array of their cocktails (they have a stellar HH btw) and just about every drink was good!

Ava, went to fix my drink for it to be on the sweeter side, not once, but TWICE, and it was PERFECT then. She made sure that I was happy not only with my drink, but my experience, here.2.) I'd asked for garlic butter. Not only did she bring out melted butter that she added garlic to, but she went BEYOND THAT and put it over a small candle to keep warm! I'll add a picture of it.She went above my expectations, and I truly did and do appreciate her! The next time I come, I hope to have her at my table!

387,"Recently tried Fogo again after a not so good experience in Pittsburgh. Gaslamp Fogo was a much better experience. I took my adult kids during the week. We arrived and were seated. Waited several minutes for our server. My kids went to the salad bar after atleast 10 mins of waiting. Finally our server arrived and took our drink orders. With our disk turned to green we waited and waited for meats to arrive as the servers kept passing us by. Finally a manager walked by and asked if everything was ok. He was told we are waiting meats to stop at our table. Within a few minutes we had 5-6 cuts of meats. The cook on the meats were great. Med/Rare. The ""bus-girl"" was the best. She kept our basket of cheese bread full and water full. Even provided us w clean plates. After another 15-20 lull in food arriving a different manager stopped by and asked if he could send out some meats. We gave our list to him and several minutes later they arrived. This happened another time as meat servers kept passing by our table. Fogo gets 4 stars because of the lack of meats showing up without the manager asking for them. The taste and cook on the meats were very good. The grilled cheese w spicy honey was amazing. Its a must try. If you are ever at Fogo and having the same issue aa we did, please speak up to the manager. They will make sure the requested meats arrive at your table. A competitor Brazilian Steakhouse nearby is our favorite. But Fogo offers some different cuts and food. We will be back to Fogo",4.0

I've had nothing but good things to say for both visits and my review will be updated as such.The main reason why I had a more pleasant experience was that both times I came during off-peak times. The first time was dinner on a Wednesday at 5pm and the other was a Sunday at 4pm. I wasn't specifically aiming for an off-peak time but the other people in my party had requested their specific reservation times. Staff this time were much more kind and attentive and I even got to do small talk as the gauchos served their meats.The churrasco dinner experience is at $61.95/person and includes at least 10 cuts of meat. The best cuts IMO are the filet, ribeye, bottom sirloin (fraldinha), top sirloin (picanha), and beef/pork ribs. In every visit I always go for these. Protip: the cuts of meat offered are on the menu. If you notice that a cut of meat isn't making its rounds please ask for it. This is almost always in the case of the ribs and I make it a point to ask for them when I'm almost at my meat quota. The sides are delicious provided that they are served fresh. This is especially true for the pao de queijo and the polenta. They serve as my carb source and palate cleansers for the meats. They are not as good if they sit out in the cold for too long.The wines I had here are also pretty good. On my first visit I stumbled upon a half-off wine sale and I was able to score a pretty delicious Malbec. On my second visit I brought a Tablas Creek Esprit de Tablas (GSMs go very well with barbecued meats) and they were able to fulfill my instructions of putting the wine in a decanter in order for it to aerate. Corkage is $25.Because of my last two positive experiences I will put Fogo de Chao back on the rotation for steakhouses in SD. It seems like the restaurant is suitable to bring larger parties on short notice provided the reservation isn't during peak times.",4.0
391,"I tried emailing my concerns to the e-mail that's listed in the review response. A week has passed and no response from anyone. To Fogo: if you are going to give me this option, please acknowledge the email and address my concerns in a timely fashion. Thanks.",1.0
392,"On Father's Day weekend I went to Fogo de Chão for the first time since COVID. While for the most part the menu remains the same, the experience has somewhat degraded. Here are my observations.- The dinner pricing has now jumped to $60.95. I guess the justification for this now is the inclusion of ribeye and filet mignon as one of the churrasco meats. For $60.95 I wouldn't go just for ribeye or filet - I can easily get those at a steakhouse for cheaper and better quality. BUT as part of the churrasco experience it is a nice touch.- Additional non-meat items included melted cheese that tasted like kanafeh and a pineapple sprinkled with cinnamon. They served as palate cleansers that cut between the hearty meats. - Also notable is the additions such as the indulgent appetizers, indulgent cuts and entrees. The entrees primarily serve as an aside for people who want to do the sides/market table but for some reason can't do the full churrasco experience (ie vegetarians/pescatarians). Nice touch to be more inclusionary.- The sides dishes are okay but lesser quality than previous visits. Caramelized bananas and polenta are still good but the pão de queijo is not as soft/fluffy and the mashed potatoes are a bit bland.- As for the actual meats I'm not sure if this is because our party went on Father's Day weekend but I saw less meats being passed around. I remember seeing the seasonal cut (garlic picanha?), picanha, filet mignon and ribeye being passed around but not so much the other cuts. Didn't see so much the sausage, top/bottom sirloins, bacon-wrapped chicken/steak or chicken, much less the beef/pork ribs or leg of lamb. However I do remember other staff (not the gauchos serving meat) did ask if anyone in our party wanted any specific meats, so I guess the onus is on the customer to know what they want. But if one doesn't know the full Fogo menu they are essentially screwing themselves.- My favorite meat is still the costela (beef ribs). It's still served in a cutting board and still soft when served. They still serve one of the best beef rib cuts in San Diego. And this is considering that I also had the ribeye and filet.Service was okay considering that it was Father's Day. I didn't experience any of the staff attitude problems mentioned in other people's reviews. My only issue regarding service was that it took a while to get someone to get my bottle of wine opened and to get wine glasses so that I could serve the wine. Overall the experience is okay. It's good if one wants the Brazilian churrascaria experience as it's the best in SD (I prefer this to Rei do Gado). However due to the price bump of $60.95 if I'm going for meat quality I can more easily find this at my preferred steakhouses for sometimes even cheaper. So YMMV on whether the experience is worth the cost.",3.0
393,"This review is for the SDRW experience. Actual rating 3.5.The concept of SD's semi-annual Restaurant Week series is to try a restaurant you may not have gone to before or to lessen the expense of an otherwise upscale restaurant. From $10-$30 for lunches and $20-$50 for dinners you'll be treated to a multi-course meal that ideally spans a restaurant's offerings. For SDRW Fogo de Chao offers a $40/person dinner with most of the offerings of the regular experience ($54.95). 10 meats are available in comparision to 16 of the regular menu, but in lieu of some of the premium cuts at least you get dessert!Here are the cuts offered for SDRW.Picanha (Prime part of the Top Sirloin) - Seasoned with sea salt or garlicAlcatra (Top Sirloin) - Seasoned for tenderness and sliced thinFraldinha (Bottom Sirloin) - Flavorful steak with strong marblingMedalhões com Bacon (Bacon-Wrapped Steak) - Hardwood smoked, honey-cured baconCordeiro (Leg of Lamb) - Fresh and tenderLombo (Pork) - Parmesan-encrusted pork loin filetsCostela de Porco (Pork Ribs) - Slow-roasted for flavor and tendernessBisteca de Porco (Pork Chops) - Cured, center-cut, roasted on the boneLinguiça (Pork Sausage) - Slow-roasted and savoryFrango (Chicken) - Breast, bacon-wrapped breast or tender legsFor those that have an idea of the typical meats served at churrascarias this serves as a good introduction to those that have never eaten at one. As I have mentioned in my regular Fogo de Chao reviews, I prefer the cuts of meat here to neighboring Rei do Gado because not only are the meats higher quality, you can also specify some cuts of meat to order. This was evident with my last dining party as all of us ordered various levels of doneness from rare to medium. And for $40/person it *is* a steal compared to the regular dining if you like the standard cuts as you get that, the salad bar, the included sides (cheese bread, garlic mashed potatoes, polenta fries and fried banana) AND dessert at the end! Among my party we enjoyed the key lime pie and New York cheesecake though both desserts are on the richer side.However in light of experiencing the SDRW menu for myself I much prefer doing the full experience and I will pay the additional $14 to ""upgrade"". This is because my most favorite cuts of meat simply aren't offered in the SDRW menu and you can't just pay extra to have it as a side - all of your party must agree to do the SDRW menu or full experience. There's something to be said about beef ribs, ribeye and lamb chops served here. Not only are they some of my most favorite cuts of meat, on a good day Fogo does them very well and it's one of my favorite places in SD if I'm craving good meat from the grill. Though dessert costs extra I can get molten chocolate cake or the papaya cream (not included in SDRW) or walk over to Ghirardelli for their ice cream sundaes.SDRW is a great opportunity to try Fogo de Chao if you're on a budget and don't care about the premium meats. I'm just glad that you can do the full experience should you not want to do SDRW for any reason, which is good considering that some restaurants only offer the SDRW menu during that week. Even if I didn't get to try my favorite meats this time I'm glad that business is still going strong 5 years since it first opened. Ever since I ate here it's been my preferred Brazilian churrascaria in SD.",4.0
394,"To commemorate Yelp's introduction into the lusosphere the following review is about the most well-known churrascaria chain in the US: Fogo de Chão (shoun). Thanks to the BFF/ODP (no longer the frequent dining partner :( ) for taking me here and for your unwavering support through 2 years of the MLT program. As of this writing I prefer going here instead of Rei do Gado for AYCE churrasco BBQ. ---CONCEPT: Barbecue done in the ""churrasco"" style made famous by the gauchos (cowboys) that reside in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul (southernmost state of Brazil). You get a chip that controls the service; green side allows the gauchos to bring their meats to you, while red side indicates the gauchos to skip your table. PARKING: Located in the building previously home to Borders, Park-it-on-Market is right across, with Mon-Thurs parking rates $1/hr. Considering how expensive it is to eat here you will be grateful for cheap parking.VENUE: Very spacious. Salad bar is closest to the entrance with a selection of fresh veggies, salad and cheese. Restaurant seats 300ish people. Restaurant itself looks like a wine cellar.SERVICE: Like Rei Do Gado, there's two different types of servers: the gauchos that distribute the meat and the other waiters who will take your drink orders and check up on you. These waiters REALLY check up on you; they asked me and the ODP how we were doing every 10 minutes. Major props to them as they did give me one of the missing meats without having to turn the chip around to green (as it was already red).FOOD/DRINK: For $46.50pp for dinner and $29.50pp for lunch, you will have access to unlimited meats, sides and the salad bar. For salad bar only you'll be looking at $28.50pp dinner and $22.50pp lunch. There's additional cost for drinks or other additional menu items (ie dessert)Drinks: Got myself the caipirinha. LOTS of limes but even with the limes the drink was smooth. It makes a good pre-drink, not so much drinking with meats. Gotta have it with red wine next time I come here...Brazilian lemonade is a very sweet drink made with sugar water, limes and condensed milk. Tart and creamy.Salad Bar: Vegetables were fresh, but that is to be expected when the restaurant just opened. Had a heart of palm for the first time, tasted like an artichoke heart. Sides: Unlike Rei Do Gado there are four limitless sides: pão de queijo (warm cheese bread), crispy hot polenta, garlic mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas. These are served as soon as you are seated. All the sides are delicious but can get cold easily, which sucks if you are trying to pace yourself. The pão de queijo loses some of its flavor when cold. Upon request they serve farofa, a staple of Brazilian bbq.Meats: Unlike Rei Do Gado you can also specify some meats to order. 16 meats is A LOT OF MEAT. I starved myself for the entire day and I was only able to eat ~8 meats and take nibbles on the rest. OBVIOUSLY they won't let you take leftovers home :(Picanha: sirloin cap. Soft when ordered medium rare.Beef ancho: Didn't like the marinade, tasted red wine.Pork ribs: A bit overcooked. Meat didn't fall off the bone.Beef ribs: More flavorful and the meat was softer than the pork ribsLinguiça: Mouthwatering slow-roasted pork sausage.Cordeiro: Though good, I've had better leg of lamb elsewhere.Rack of lamb: Best meat of the offeringsDessert: For the first time I tried their signature papaya cream with crème de cassis (optional). Papaya was smooth and creamy and the cassis added a slight berry aftertaste. You really have to mix the cassis and papaya in order to get the full taste of the dessert. ODP says that it was the best papaya dessert he's tasted. It's a unique dessert and I had to get used to the cassis, but the papaya/cassis combination can take away the aftertaste of the meats.",5.0

400,"This was a terrible experience all around. We had a 6pm birthday reservation for over 2-months (group of 10). We showed up 15-minutes early for our reservation and the line to get in the building was out the door. After waiting in line for about 30-minutes we get to the front and the female hostess aggressively told us the wait for reservations was over an hour.... She was not friendly in the slightest, yelling MIJO, MIJO at my girlfriend to get her attention. She was also filthy, her white shirt had what appeared to be coffee or dirt stains ALL over the front. It was the most bizarre thing I've seen at a ""high end"" restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter. After waiting for over an hour we were seated but had to split the group up because they could only take 6 of us at one table. We were put in the very back of the restaurant with no silverware or napkins on the table (which the server apologized for) and when I say jammed in, I mean it... we were less than 4-feet from the other tables and I'm pretty sure there were more people inside than city code allows. It was hot, sweaty and gross. The buffet was not good, most of the food was gone or sitting out for a while. When the meat started coming around there was no filet in sight, we had to request it multiple times and didn't arrive at our table until the check did. The bathrooms were FILTHY and they apparently ran out of paper towels because they had cocktail napkins and toilet paper to use instead (see photos). Because it took so long to get seated, everyone in the party had to leave halfway through to spend another $30 to extend the parking meter outside. Not to mention the website says there is valet parking when there is NOT. This is the craziest thing I've seen in a long time. What a total mess AND A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Definitely not a good birthday dinner.",5.0

402,"So...word of warning to everyone looking to dine here - your reservation is just not worth anything. At a normal restaurant they take reservations for the tables that they have. Judging by the massive crowd at the front of the restaurant, most of whom have reservations and are being forced to wait 30-60 minutes past their reservation time, management here clearly INTENTIONALLY overbooks on a CONSISTENT basis. This is just terrible business practice that corporate either condones or encourages. This really tarnishes the brand - I just heard someone, after waiting 45 min for a reservation he thought he had, yell out ""I don't want to spend my money here anymore, I'm going to flemings!"" I understand staffing is tough but this restaurant had a decision to make - either seat how many people they actually have staff for (and take reservations accordingly) or just go for the money grab, take all the reservations despite not having enough staff - and they clearly picked the latter. Can't really support these deceptive business practices for what is supposed to be a high end restaurant. This is just so incredibly dishonest - highly doubt I will be returning.",5.0

408,"I was going on a date night and had a reservation here on a Tuesday night. It was fairly busy and we were seated along the wall. SERVICE: 2/5The problem arose with where we were seated because throughout the service, we were constantly ignored by the gauchos who only took notice of the tables around us. There was also another big table (10+ People) that had a lot of presence, making the gauchos consistently come service them and by the time they were done, there was either no meat left or the burnt ends of the meat. It seemed like we had two servers that seemed like they cared, but when I asked for certain meats (Lamb Chop/Filet Mignon), it took around 30-40 minutes to get it. I never received the extra bread that I ordered as well so I'm not really sure what their job is.FOOD QUALITY: 1/5I'm sure that a majority of the problems occurred because of the problems listed above, but most of the cuts of meat that we received were either too salty or burnt. It felt like I was chewing a tire at one point. Not really sure what happened to the quality over the years but it seems like people still like eating tires as it was extremely packed. I think the salad bar was the best part of the meal. Overall, I cant recommend going here for a date night or for anything to be honest. From the service, to the food quality, the whole experience was just miserable.",4.0

Tables crammed together, no way the servers serving the table behind wouldn't be touching me the entire time they crammed the tables that much. I don't know if they overbooked but we were delayed in seating. The entryway was absolute madness. Elbow to elbow. No crowd control. And it was that crowded it needed crowd control. Then they packed the tables leading to and from the entry so there was a 3 foot clearance where you could walk through to get the rest of the restaurant. Salad bar: impossible to go around without bumping into people. Is packing the entry way and restaurant like that even legal? Regardless it felt super chaotic. Food was the same but if you hate crowds and prefer a more relaxed atmosphere eating this is not the place to go.Our server Lupe was also doing his best, but he was looking harassed. Overall really chaotic and I felt claustrophobic the entire time. There is absolutely not enough money in the world to put our customers at risk like that.

Unfortunately, not the most memorable.   I had asked 3 different staff members for a clean set of utensils for the salad bar as someone had dropped the serving spoon on the floor and placed back at the bar. I was ignored by one, Told ""I'm in the middle of something"" by another, and left waiting for the 3rd to return.  Which he didn't . Salad bar had very few options, unlike my past experience with many different fresh dishes available.  There was one type of fruit (papaya) and a few other things that I simply didn't have the courage to try. I served myself a simple salad with some eggplant.  Unfortunately, A bug was found in the salad!!!Meat was good. Howeve, we had waited over 40 minutes to be served. Waiters walked right passed us multiple times despite me trying to get their attention.  I told the manager and he made it a point to send the staff our way.  Kind of ridiculous when the entire concept is to have to tell them ""no more"" with a colored coin.   I wanted to do something special for my son's birthday but it was simply a bad experience.  Ethan, our waiter, did his best and was very professional and accommodating.

433,"Came here recently for a holiday party and was I in for a surprise. Arrived early so my friend and I went to the bar to enjoy a cocktail before everyone else came to join us. The cocktail was nothing to rave home about. I got the Jorge sour that was listed as one of their happy hour drink. Now when we were seated was going to be the worst experience anyone could have imagined. I haven't been to any of the Fogo de Chao locations but I have been to a few of the other Brazilian steakhouses previously. I was expecting the servers to continuously come to the point where I would have to turn the card over to stop and enjoy the meats that were already obtained. However it was the opposite, where we were seated was in the surrounded by tables celebrating a birthday party. So when the servers were coming around to serve our table was basically a surprise as instead of having a lot of different types of meats I probably ate more vegetables. The meats service was extremely lacking as there were times where no meat would even come around for over half an hour. It got to the point where I would constantly get up to the salad bar to even have anything to eat. The prosciutto was awful... the slices were extremely thick instead of having thin slices. Ordering drinks was a horrible experience, drinks would not come and we would have to constantly ask about them. To have an order of a soda take over an hour to finally come is ridiculous. Cocktails were ordered and time passed by to the point we were told that the drinks were not even entered. Our waitress did comp those 3 drinks which is why the rating wasn't just one star. When we did finally place an order for meat and the pineapple the wait staff went to a different table instead. What an awful experience at the steakhouse.",2.0

435,"I came in with a reservation for 730 and wasn't seated until 9. I had to wait an hour and a half along with many other guests who also had reservations. Others waited at least 2 hours! I could only assume that on top of being overbooked, they did not turn away walk ins when they should have. This is a major management issue.I was very unhappy that there wasn't any transparency about the wait on top of the reservation. They just told me ""we will text you when your table is ready"". If I had been told from the beginning it was taking so long I could have avoided wasting my time by going elsewhere. They eventually started telling guests it was a 30 minute wait later in the evening, but that was clearly not true either.Additionally, servers never stopped at my table for lamb and I had to stop someone to get lamb. The lamb was severely over cooked. They also ran out of many desserts.I had a reservation for thanksgiving, but I'm glad for knowing that they don't honor reservations so I could go somewhere else for the holiday dinner.",1.0

439,"I have been to other Brazilian churrascaria steakhouses previously and loved it, but always heard that Fogo de Chao was the BEST! So when I heard that we were going there for my nephew's graduation dinner on Mother's Day, saying I was beyond excited would've been an understatement. After the experience there, saying I was disappointed and let down would be an even bigger understatement. We got there for our reservation and we're told they were running behind on their reservations and that it would be an additional 40 minutes. It didn't end up taking that long so not a big deal. Went to a bathroom while we waited for our table and the restroom was one of the dirtiest I've seen in a long while. There were also no paper towels in the restroom. My sister said the women's bathroom was in the same terrible state. We were sat at our table, and it was 8-10 mins before someone said anything to us. I fully understand it's a busy day so they probably won't be able to come to your table right away, but a ""hey, I'll be with you shortly"" as someone walk by would've been appreciated. We placed our drink order and were told to start with the Market Table. There was a good selection but the black beans and rice were out. My mom went back at least three times throughout the meal and found it empty every time. We started to eat. They bring out all but one of the drinks. The last drink didn't come out for another 10 minutes. Even with all the hiccups already, I still had high hopes because the star of the show in my eyes, the meat, was starting to come to our table. Very early on, we were offered a cut of meat but no one at our table had tongs to assist in getting the meat to our plates. We were promised tongs multiple times and didn't receive any tongs for most of the meal. By the time we received a few pairs, most of our group had already finished eating (they basically just gave up because of how difficult it was to eat). The meat was delicious, but pretty much everything else was in incredibly underwhelming. I wanted to love Fogo de Chao, but between the poor service, forgotten items, etc. it made for a poor first experience. I hope it was just a bad night on a very busy night, but I did not get what I was anticipating. Not sure when, if ever, I'll give it a second chance.",4.0

The salad bar is great for someone who doesn't want only meat for an entire meal (which is most people), however I wasn't extremely impressed with everything there. Majority of the meat was excellent, there were a few that I wasn't a fan of, but that's more on preference. I would highly recommend this as a fun, different date idea!",4.0

447,"Went there last Saturday night for dinner. I have been to Fogo in Chicago, Vegas and Beverly Hills and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. On the way there I was bragging to my guests about all the cuts of meats they were about to enjoy. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I was there with my 15 year old son and his best friend. 2 hungry teenagers expecting the meal of their lives. Instead they received a few over seasoned pieces of picanha and sirloin. Bread and potatoes were not served until we asked for them several times. The rib eye, filet and skirt steak I had promised the boys never appeared at our table. On several occasions I reminded our server that we were not being served and each time he assured me that they will be coming around. He even indicated that he will let his manager know because the meat servers will listen to him but it didn't make a difference. I recall, in the past that when dining at Fogo the meat was so abundant to where we would actually have to turn over our card to the red side. I have even hosted our company dinner here at the San Diego location with a group of 15+ and received far better service than I did with my group of 3. This time around we were holding up the green side but we were not being served. They had a promotion going on for $39 that only included certain cuts of meat. We paid full price and only received the promo items. The least the server could have done was to charge us the promo price but instead we were charged full price. None of us our happy and we will not be returning.",1.0

449,"I came here onto celebrate Mother's Day and was honestly so disappointed. I had a similarly bad experience over a year ago, but I thought that it could've just been a fluke. However, I came here again and it was arguably worse than the first time. The service was extremely slow, which I usually don't mind too much but it was the fact that our table was constantly getting skipped. There were many different meats that would pass our table, but by the time they got to us they already ran out. I would try to make efforts to make requests but they wouldn't even look our way. The overall environment was just very crowded and there were even people waving their green cards in the air because they weren't getting served. I tried to give this place another chance because I've been to other locations of the same franchise, but I honestly will not be coming back again. On a positive note, our busser/greeter was super sweet. Other than that, I don't have anything good to say about this experience.",1.0

The servers here were really friendly as well, but I felt as if my table was disregarded for a majority of our time there. It was strange because our table was directly in front of the kitchen, but the servers would rarely stop at our table to serve us the different meats. For such an extravagant price, I was expecting to leave feeling satisfied and full but the reality was quite the opposite. I spent most of the night eating sides to get full. Overall the food was good, but I would say that the crowdedness of the place in combination with the lack of attentiveness from the servers made the experience a bit lackluster.",1.0

There was no order or instructions from team members. I waited in line outside but then saw a bunch of people bypassing the line to ""check-in"". After 75 min, I kindly asked the hostess about our position in line but it was obvious she was annoyed. Other customers were berating her left and right. She told us that it was Christmas and that it was busy. I understood. But many people probably planned their evenings out with the reservations and 2 hour waits would definitely throw a wrench into our Christmas plans. The front-end service was disappointing and there were a lot of hangry people.Once seated, the service was fabulous. Great people and food. We're big fans of churrasco and have been to fogo de chao many times in San Francisco, Las Vegas, LA, and Irvine. I didn't recall a meat menu to see of the experience but the variety was not the same as at other locations. The price has been the same (compared to downtown SF at least) since 4-5 years ago but there seemed to be less variety. The salad bar also lacked variety and I missed the diced mango salad. The rice was never refilled throughout the evening and as for fruits, even though there were whole cantaloupes on display, they were not cut for customers.

The bacon wrapped steak guy came to visit us three times to offer it but they advertised 16 different foods but we only had 5 at the time so we wanted to try new stuff since we already tried the bacon wrapped steak.It's quite frustrating when our table is spending upwards of $100 per person and it seems nobody is stopping by with food. It's not the fault of the servers by any means, I think there are too many tables and not enough cooks. The servers come out with a skewer and run out after a few tables.After talking with 3 servers to request new food, they keep giving empty promises of bringing more food but we had no luck, we then found a nice waitress that was able to help us get the food we wanted.

Some requested items were never brought but all things a side we came for the meat and boy did we get it! My favorite by far was surprising the cheese and honey. I skipped it the first time around like so random but everyone at the table urged me to try it and by their reactions I had to and HOLY COW YESSS!

467,"Let me just start out with saying that I've been to Fogo de Chao multiple times for multiple occasions. We generally have a good time, but let this review be a warning to you and a reminder to myself to stay away during holidays. This time we made a reservation for 3 at 5:15 pm for Thanksgiving, 2022. We got to the restaurant around the time of our reservation and noticed there was a line going around the corner. It turned out that this line was for people who already had reservations who were ""checking in"" at the front desk. We waited in that line for 30-40 minutes, and when we got to the front, the hostess said they're behind on the reservations, and that it would be another 30-40 minutes until we get our table, which was understandable as it was Thanksgiving.  What was unacceptable was that we did not get seated until 7 pm. I understand being behind on holidays, but having a reservation and essentially being delayed 2 hours is inexcusable. When we got in the restaurant, it was clear that the restaurant was way overbooked; there were extra tables thrown which blocked walkways and gave the whole restaurant a sense of chaos.We were seated and warmly greeted by multiple waiters, which was nice. Unfortunately it took quite some time for any meat to get to our table; which was again understandable because the restaurant was so crowded that any meat that came out got taken immediately. The meat that we did get was mostly good, but it was clear that the meats were rushed in cooking as it was cooked blue despite asking for a medium rare piece. We ended up only really getting to try 5 or so cuts of meat despite there being over 12 options. We asked our waitress who politely apologized and asked the kitchen to send out specific cuts that we wanted. After 10 minutes or so, she came back to ask how we liked those cuts, to which we responded that we never received them. She apologized again and said she'd ask the kitchen to send out the meat again. This process repeated itself maybe 4 or 5 more times, with us getting fuller and fuller off the same 4 cuts through the night. We ended up just asking for the check in the end with our waitress asking one final time if we'd like her to ask the kitchen once more to send out the cut but we were just too full and frustrated to wait more. This definitely was not the waitress' fault as she was only polite and courteous; I understand that the kitchen was likely just swamped. All in all this was definitely one of the worst experiences that we've had at Fogo de Chao. If you take anything from this review, take the warning not to visit during holidays, but if you do, then expect crazy delays and lackluster meats.Edit: emailed Fogo but still got no response after almost 2 weeks.

473,"Came here with a party of 9 for my husbands birthday. We went on a Sunday evening. I made reservations ahead of time and had to call to add on guests. Thankfully they were able to accommodate. We have eaten here in the past but it's been awhile. Upon reading recent reviews, I was concerned if we were placed in a corner- we'd be overlooked by the meats coming by. So I requested to be near the food bar area or close to wherever the food comes out. Due to our larger party- we ended up being placed in the corner anyway. Thankfully, our server was attentive and whenever we requested a certain meat- it came by in a timely manner. Majority of the meats are medium rare ish. So if u need well done. U should tell them ahead of time but for me- not a problem. Some of our party likes theirs well done. They bring some side dishes to your table like garlic mash potatoes, fried polenta, cheesy breads (my favorite- we ordered a bunch for the table and were able to take some home), and caramelized banana. My favorite meat is always the picanha. We also like the grilled pineapple. They also have a few different sauces that we had to request - chimichurri, mint chimichurri (can go with the lamb I guess?), horse radish. The salad bar has charcuterie meats and cheeses, salads, rice, beans. They also have a dessert menu. This place is located downtown. We were able to find street parking a few blocks over.",1.0

475,"Took my boyfriend here for a Father's Day dinner and it was a total disaster!  This was his first time and our last time visiting this restaurant. We had reservations but when we arrive there was a huge crowd of people outside waiting to get in. The girls at the front door seemed to be very unhappy to be there. We checked in and had to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated. Our name was called so we walked up to the girl at the door snd she just opened it but didn't say anything and closed it behind us. We then stood at the counter while 2 girls didn't address us and just kept talking amongst themselves. So after a few moments I asked if we should continue standing there or would someone be seating us. The restaurant was jam packed, had to be over capacity as we had to shimmy to get to our table. We were a party of four and the tables were so small and close together we were bumping elbows with the people at the table next to us. We sat for maybe 10 minutes before a waiter came by to get our drink order. So we then squeezed out of our seats to head to the salad bar. The line was up and down the aisles. We finally make it to the salad bar and there's aren't anything in any of the platters. Yes it was bush but the salad bar wasn't even stocked. We make it to our seats with just olives and salad as those were the only real options and now we wait for our meat. Very table around us has meat but the servers run out before they get to us. Mind u the huge table to our left is sever. The table of 5 our right has meat, but here we are with water and lettuce, no sides or drinks. We've been here at least 45 minutes. So we flag down the waiter, he sees no one has meat, our serving plates are clean and only 2 sets of silverware. He says, ""I'm just gonna let you know we are very busy. Under staffed and it's jam packed so it's not my fault! We have a lot of people who called out. Eggs do you want me to do, get the manager?!"" He then proceeds to argue with who we assumed was the manager right in front of us. We're now at an hour before our first meat is offered, we kindly asked for well done selections but those never arrived. We literally had to raise our hand or usher a server to the table to be served. Our bill was roughly $400 as the only thing we could get quickly was alcohol. After spending $400, we stopped at the taco shop on the way home bc we were all still hungry.

482,"I just went to Fogo for the first time, we were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. They do have a bar area, and then the main dining area.  The main entree option is the unlimited meats with the feijoada bar.  They do offer a few optional entrees two were a fish dish and one was vegetarian.  The feijoada bar was amazing, with so many options to choose from.  You have to be careful not to fill up on those sides, so you have room for the delicious meats they come around with.  My favorite was the cheese popovers before they bring the meat and the ribeye, it was amazing.  They brought around garlic steak, ribeye, strip steak, filet mignon, chicken, and sausage.  They were a bit slow, but it was busy in the restaurant.  They didn't even bring us the sausage until most of us were already finished.At one point they brought a liquor cart around and you could order shots.The staff was very friendly and answered our questions.",5.0
483,The food was so good the location is amazing and the staff is very helpful/ funny! Chicken Mike and Rośe were so amazing to us the whole night !!!

484,"I visited this location on Monday January 2nd with a group of 9 people and 1 baby. We have been to Fogo de Chao before and weren't super impressed at that experience. This restaurant wasn't our initial plan. We had a family member visiting who wanted to eat Brazilian steak house so we planned to go to Rei Do Gado. Unfortunately the grill was broken so they weren't taking in any people. So we ended up here. Before sitting down to eat I went to the women's restroom to change my babies diaper. I get into large stall with the changing table and I see the changing table in already down with a pool of water in it... the ceiling was leaking! So I couldn't use the changing table. I had to lay my baby on the counter space in between the two sinks. First I had to wipe the counter top down as it was covered in water. We are then seated. I asked for a high chair and the hostess said I need to get rid of my stroller first. So I folded it up and tucked it away. She never came with the high chair. I then asked the waiter. He did bring me one. We ordered a round a drinks, they were good. We then got the first rounds a meat. To me the only meat worth filling up on was the Picana, the beef rib, and the T-bone steak. I could do without the rest. The salad bar was unappetizing in appearance. And forget being able to see what you're eating or how your meat is cooked. It's incredibly dark in there. The garlic steak cubes were hunks of fat and rare meat. I do not recommend bringing small children here as some of the servers have no regards to where they're holding their knives. One server even cut the meat over my baby in the high chair. I held my hands over her head because I was so nervous if he was bumped into or slipped it wouldn't be good. We requested certain meats and it took forever to make its way to our table. You go out and spend money for good food and a good experience and this was not it. Disappointed in the service and cleanliness of the place.",4.0

486,"Thank you to Fogo de Chao staff for being open on a very busy Veteran's Day weekend and offering one of the best discounts out there! I really appreciate the patience of the staff who were dealing with so many people at the front lobby.  I called ahead and made reservations before this place got too busy during the dinner hours so we were eating dinner around 4pm which worked out great because by the time we left around 5:30pm the line to get in was packed and spilling into the downtown street!! I did not take any food pics this time because I was so hungry and the lighting in this place is very dim so you don't know what time it really is but the market salad bar and feijoida bar area were plenty for me to get a full plate and still enjoy all the Brazilian side dishes like the grilled pineapple, the pao de quiejo, yucca, plantains and the mashed potatoes which were delicious!! Comes out in a tiny silver dish and you can request more with your server.  My caipirinha took a little longer to get to me due to how busy this place was but my server was checking on it and when it got to my table, I was perfectly pleased as they made it extra strong for me! And my husband and I both had desserts from their menu: he had tres leches cake and I had the key lime pie that was just as tart as I was hoping for and was so full by the time we left, we had to take a few laps to walk around the block into 5th street before we went back to the car! Overall, I love this place.  I see how everyone else pretty much loves it too!  They offered 50% off the meal check for Veteran's Day Military Discount and I don't know what other place does that for this type of dining service.  Really appreciated it! I will be back to this place! :)",4.0
487,"After almost a year of not eating meat, (I consider myself a pescatarian), I can say that this place has great vegetarian options if you're with a crowd of meat eaters!  I loaded up at the salad bar and still feel like I got my money's worth here.  I did order the pan seared salmon prepared with chimichurri sauce with asparagus and by the time it came out I was already full! Lol. But for the dining experience, service on a holiday weekend, COVID-19 precautions and sanitation in place and menu options, I like this place than some of the other Brazilian churrascuria's I have been to for a chain restaurant.  Would recommend to make reservations for a party larger than two or just in general because it's downtown and it gets busy on the weekends since indoor dining has opened up.  Wear your mask when going up to the salad bar and don't forget the feijoada, rice, and farofa are behind you when you circle back around to the other side of the salad bar.",2.0
488,"Soooo disappointed in the food service today. Today was Father's Day, and we did expect it to be busier and were VERY patient during the entire ""meal"", but at one point, we had sat there without receiving even any offers of meat for 30 MINUTES!!!! In the 1hr and 45minutes that we were seated, we received offers for only FOUR of the 16 meats that they serve. When we spoke to the ""customer service representative"", instead of a manager, all that they offered was taking off ONE of the meals. We barely ate anything AND STILL had to pay over $100!!! That's wild! If you are wanting to go for a holiday, DONT!!! They are not able to accommodate or give proper service when they are this busy!",5.0

496,"I was kinda disappointed eating here. I was so excited to come here. I had such a good experience in the Scottsdale, Arizona location restaurant.My experience in the San Diego restaurant was not the same. We all got the churrasco experience. Continuous tableside service of different kinds of meats.We we're seated by the front of the restaurant. I made sure to have all our cards to the green side because we were all ready for some delicious meat. and all the men with the meats would literally pass our table without stopping at our table. I had to ask our waiter a couple of times if we could have people come to our table. We were waiting for long periods of time for different meats. It was so aggravating and for $42.95 per person. It was kinda ridiculous. The meats we did get were good. My favorite were the lamb chops. But the overall experience there was just not good. The wait between meats was long. And the guys with the meats would walk by so fast. It was hard to catch them.I just couldn't believe the difference in locations. If I had to pick another Brazilian place to eat I would go to Texas de Brazil. I've never had a bad experience at that restaurant. And I also never had to ask for people to come by our table for different cuts of meat.I would definitely go back to the Arizona Scottsdale restaurant though.Hopefully this restaurant will do better and stop by every table.",3.0

500,"I really wanted to like this spot. We came here for dinner with a group of 4 and this was my first time dining at Fogo. The food was good but the service was so, so below average for the price point per person ($62.99/person). I know times are hard right now with understaffing and COVID and I work in the industry so I try to be sympathetic but you would think an establishment like this would have it together or would take less reservations for better service. It took a minimum of 20 minutes to get our drinks to the table and a lot of our orders were forgotten and had to be re-ordered. We ordered a few rounds of drinks and each time, it took quite a while for the beverages to come out. At one point, a drink we didn't order was brought out and we told the server that we didn't order it but he ended up leaving it anyway, which was fine if the drink was going to be comp'd but when they dropped the bill, it was charged. We had to wait for a server to come around again to let them know we shouldn't have been charged. I asked for a refill on bread which was obviously forgotten so I had to remind our server the next time he stopped by the table (must have been at least a half hour later) and then he made it clear that he forgot, went to go check and said the bread was in the oven so it took at least another 15-20 minutes for the bread to come out. Angel wasn't our server but was very personable last night every time he stopped by our table with different proteins and probably the best part of our dining experience overall. Very disappointing experience because it came highly recommended but overall, overpriced & underimpressed.",0.0

508,"If I could give this place a zero star, I would.I came into Fogo with high hopes. I was excited to finally have dinner here; however the night was filled with many ups and downs.Here's the breakdown:Ups: When we first got seated we were greeted by an amazing waitress. She was super friendly, did great at explaining the menu/drink options, and checked on us frequently. Another positive- the mango habanero drink is KILLER. If you do come to this establishment, order that. Downs: Right after choosing from the menu, meat rarely came to our table. I noticed that they just finished a long rush, so I had grace. But over the amount of time there, I got only 5 meat choices. Also, sometime during our meal our waitress apparently ended her shift. (I will note here that I was shocked that she did not update us that her shift was ending/ or possibly on a break, idk since she didn't tell us anything.) This being said, we were looking around for her because she placed my mango habanero drink in & I still didn't get in within 20 minutes. We got another waitress to get our drink after that time limit & we were utterly disappointed by then so wanted to go home. Let me tell you that was ANOTHER disappointment. We got our check, gave our card, and waiting more than 10 minutes for it to get returned to us.Overall, I have to say, I've had better service at McDonald's.",5.0

516,"Avoid at all cost. We went to celebrate my son's birthday for dinner, but this location was a total disaster. The lighting on where they had seated us was lacking, so it was very dark. The meats were very slow to come out, we patiently waited and understand that the place was getting packed. What got me ranting here though is that when the meats finally reached our table, we asked for a second serving as it is a buffet so an extra slice of meat is not uncommon to request. However, our server refused and said he needs to serve the whole table first before giving an extra slice. We were a party of six, and no one else was on our table. There was no need to embarass one of our companion, and not accommodate such a meager request. It is outrageous to pay 67 dollars for a buffet and your server refuses to serve you food. We asked for a manager to help defuse the situation, but she never showed up. Multiple requests were made to different staff members for management's help but no one cared at all. We were only visiting this fogo location, because the fogo close to our home location in Florida always provided us great service and delicious food in our numerous visits there. Will definetely not go back to this location, and I hope that San Diego will soon have other brazilian churascos to put this one out of business.",5.0

518,"On top of the quick and efficient waiting and serving, the food was really good. The system of flipping the ""não obrigado"" in order to indicate you would like to try the meat is a marvelous way to allow the servers to know if you'd like to try the meat. They were fast to serve! From the medium rare pork medallions to the honey roasted cheese, it was difficult to decide which food to select due to the wide variety of delicious meals. The salad bar was not any typical salad bar but had an assortment of appetizing cheeses, vegetables, fruits, and yogurts.",1.0

The last time was about two weeks ago, some friends and I went to celebrate a birthday and one of the waiters made one of the most inappropriate comments about someone's weight at an attempt to be funny. Not only was it inappropriate, but he didn't even apologize. Our group was a bit younger, so he might've thought that we would let the comment slide. But this was seriously the worst experience I've encountered at a restaurant.

524,"I am sad to say that Fogo has really gone downhill and I don't think I will be visiting again. Two weeks ago I took my family for what I thought would be a nice treat to celebrate birthdays. Instead it was just hours of frustration. My previous visits this was the place to be if you wanted not only amazing food (in abundance) but exceptional service too. This visit was the opposite. It all started when we arrived for our reservation and then had to wait standing in the crowded lobby for 30 minutes with no apology or update as to what was taking so long (especially when the restaurant appeared half empty). Finally at our table and then we pretty much waited and starved for three hours. As you can see from other reviews below from the same evening the food was just nonexistent. After we turned our cards to green no meat was coming around. I timed it at one point and in 30 minutes only three meats had come out (and one of them ran out before our table was all served so some of us only had two meats). And the sides weren't coming either. After the meats had finally started we still had no sides (or even any mention of them) and when I asked the waiter he said they should be ""out soon"". And then they kind of trickled out after that (including some cold cheese bread) but there was never enough. The waiter also rarely came by for water refills or anything else. When we finally were full (by visiting the salad bar and ordering dessert) no one even brought the bill and the waiter had just totally disappeared by that point.  After waiting about 20 minutes I finally just asked another waiter for the bill. I put my credit card down right away and then it just sat on the table for another 10 minutes. Hundreds of dollars wasted for an evening of annoyance. My foodie friend has been telling me for awhile that Texas de Brazil is the best Brazilian steakhouse now and I always insisted Fogo was better. Guess he was right.",0.0

No valet or dedicated parking like the other Fogo de Chaos but we found a parking garage close to it that only charges $1 per hour! 2. Their market table is close to nothing! This is by far the most empty market table I have ever seen it to be! All they had were salad and cheeses! I saw fruits when we started but when I was about to get some, they were gone. I waited for refill...nothing!3. Meats were slow! It took nearly 10mins before the first meat came out. The interval was pretty slow too. Meats were meeh. Chewy, which is not the standard for the other FDC. Salty too! 4. Our waitress was almost no where to be found most of the time. Took forever for our drinks.I understand that it was busy because of the holidays but it was a total disappointment and such a waste of our money and time!

I called the next day and spoke to the manager and the manager apologized, she had also promised to send me a gift voucher for my horrible experience. I never received the gift voucher.

The salad bar is also impressive, with a wide variety of fresh and flavorful options. But the real star of the show is the meat. The cuts are cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. The filet mignon is particularly delicious, as is the lamb. Be sure to save room for dessert, as the cheesecake is out of this world. Overall, dining at Fogo de Chao with Mike the chicken guy is an unforgettable experience that I highly recommend.",5.0
548,"Went there to celebrate with a giant dinner party of friends and family. Previously, I had a pretty off putting experience at another fogo location so needless to say I was pretty anxious about giving it another try. I didn't request for much besides being in an area that was more intimate or accessible if possible and they totally delivered! Luckily we arrived early enough where it wasn't as busy or congested. We parked in a nearby garage for $15 dollars and walked over. Be careful if you choose to do that since the area outside can be sketchy at night especially with so many homeless individuals roaming around. The restaurant itself is very cozy and clean. My only comment is that some of the meats were on the drier side, especially the chicken. Everything else was delicious including their salad bar. I would recommend sticking with top/bottom sirloin, filet mignon, and picanha. Their sides are amazing also! My favorite are the cheesy breads for sureWe ordered a few alcoholic beverages including wine and cocktails. I would recommend trying the strawberry hibiscus caipirinha, cucumber Mint Smash, and super fruit lemonade if you are looking for something more refreshing. Also there is no shame in asking for water from tap (they will not offer unless requested) because the other bottled waters they give you will not be enough for a large group unless you are willing to order a bunch of them. I prefer regular water also because they can easily refill for everyone as the meats can become quite salty during the meal. Thank you!",4.0

550,"Went here for my birthday dinner and it was definitely an experience. My favorite cuts were the beef rib, pichana, and ribeye. Our waiter was ok but the gentleman name Mack? Or Matt? Was hilarious and was very helpful! It was a little crowded and a little too dark for my preference but was overall a fun unique experience!",4.0

552,"I'll start with this, the meats were incredible. We also ordered the wagyu that came out on a piping hot salt slab which was pretty cool. That cut was also very tasty and served with chimichurri. Would recommend!If you come to a restaurant like this, then you're likely coming for the all you can eat meats. So I wouldn't deter anyone from coming for that reason. But even that wasn't enough for me to give them more than three stars. I just felt like something was missing from the experience. The place itself feels outdated and kind of old. A bit musty. It didn't feel like a 5 star elegant dining experience. I don't think there's much they can do about that but it just needs to be said. And I feel like the salad and sides bar was just sad. Picked over greens, bland veggies to choose from. Maybe I just came up at the wrong time. I just stuffed my face with the cheese rolls (always a great choice) and meat. To their credit though, all the meats were great. Flavored well, servers gave great portions/cuts. I would come back if I'm feeling like I JUST WANT MEAT AND QUANTITY NOM NOM. But for a nice date night out? Meh.",5.0

554,I was going to give this place a 3 star due to service but David more than made up for it. Had to ask for a drink multiple times but no big deal it was during comic con.

557,"Fogo de Chao Brazilian steak house is located in the Gaslamp off 6th ave and G and is serving up some of the finest meats with a extensive salad bar with a all you can eat option and is a must try when in the area!I have been here plenty of times for the salad bar and the finest cuts of meats with family and friends and I always enjoy visiting here to fill up and take advantage of the prime cuts they serve. This place can be crowded on the weekends or for any specials holiday so I recommend to have a reservation. Ordering is simple you can just enjoy the extensive salad bar for a set price or get the salad bar with the meat selection. The salad bar has everything from salami to bruschetta and fine cheeses, ceasar salads, romaine, and spinach, they also have grilled zucchini with sautéed mushrooms and many more! My favorite is the tomato with fresh mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and fresh basil.  They also have fresh bread and virgin olive oil with red wine vinegar for your dipping needs. The salad bar also has rice and beans with various dressings to dress up your beloved salad along with potatoe salad, and corn salad.Once you get your plate you just flip the card from red to green and sit back and wait to let the magic happen! Your server will come to your table and serve u fresh meat off the grill or rotisserie when he or she can see your card is green. The meats of choice go from piccana, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, bacon wrapped chicken, lamb, spicy sausage, grilled pineapple with a touch of cinnamon and many more!!Service is always great but sometimes I feel where you sit matters when getting served the meat because there has been multiple times where we were passed up on a good cut of meat because we just wernt as visible to the server or before they could come to our table they ran out and went back back for more so it's a no win situation just maybe luck as I see it. With that being said don't sleep on this restaurant and come check it out especially for there complimentary fried cheese with honey, mashed potatoes, and fried plantains and also Brazilian cheese bread which has a mochi chewey taste to it because it's definitely worth every bite!",5.0

560,"Let me preface that we had a delicious meal, and wonderful service the entire time excluding our entrance. Drinks are strong, the salad bar was delicious, meats cooked perfectly, the bread and other sides were oh so phenomenal.  We would definitely go again. Our waiters, waitress and everyone in between excluding the hostess was fantastic.  on entrance we asked for a table to seat 5, approx 3:30-4pm with no reservation 5/7. This shorter, female, Hispanic, black hair, thin in size,  long fake eyelashed girl working  was outstandingly rude. She literally gasped, dropped her mouth then started panicking when we told her we didn't have a reservation.  She looked visibly irritated, started to tell us because it was mother's day they won't have room and to just wait, while she checked with someone else.  Once she got another hostess involved we realized we were in much better hands. This other hostess(slightly older, clearly more experienced)  was much nicer, very calm and told us we would just need to wait 15mins at the bar while they arrange for us to be seated but also due to the holiday it may not work out.  I will say she definitely is used to dealing with fake eyelashes because she completely ignored her while helping our group. Our group was more than understanding and able to acknowledge that we may not have been accommodated due to the holiday/ Saturday night factor. But eyelashes for no reason was rude and made us feel like we were not wanted. On the plus she definitely gave us something to gossip about while eating. ‍",0.0
561,"If you have a special occasion or a celebration, save yourself the aggravation and go somewhere else.  We had a Mother's Day dinner booked a month in advance.  We had 5:30 reservations and when we got there there was a large group of people waiting outside, families, elderly, children, babies, and a wedding party with the bride in her wedding dress.  Everyone had reservations, but no one was allowed inside.  There was a rude hostess who checked in people who arrived at their reserved times, but could not tell us how long the wait would be or how many parties were in front of us.  Apparently the wait in the morning was up to two hours...The restaurant over booked the reservations for the Mother's Day holiday.  We waited 30 minutes and were seated at a table with barely a table cloth and no table settings or disks.  After finally getting table settings we made our way to the salad bar that was completely picked through with dry pepperoni and salami.  We got waters and potatoes and sides, but no meat...after sitting and looking around for half an hour with no service I waved my arms and a server came and asked if we needed anything.  We told her our experience, and she apologized, but she said pretty much this is the way it is today...first of all there were so many tables set up that there is barely enough room for one person to walk behind a table.  I told the server that I have been waving my arms, but we seem to be invisible and don't get any service, but that round table behind us has everyone stopping by.  That is when she told us that it's her family that is there and they are being served because she begged the gaucho's to serve them.  The gaucho's don't even look around for tables to be served, neither do the servers.  My family loves Brazilian Bar B Q and frequently go to the Beverly Hills and the El Segundo locations, as well as the one in down town LA.  We were at the El Segundo grand opening, and although service was slow it was not like this.  I'm sure the bride and the wedding party that was waiting outside had special event reservations, but she was made to wait at least half an hour in her wedding dress outside.  After speaking to the server my family decided to leave the restaurant.  This was so disappointing, being out of town and going to an establishment that we know well and love and have this horrible experience.  It was so disrespectful the way everyone was treated from the wait to the food servers.  This was not the high end dining experience that is consistent with Fogo de Chão.  We will never return to this place.  Mother's Day would have been ruined had we stayed there.  There is another Brazilian bar B Q restaurant only blocks away with much better service.",4.0

564,"Average at best (above average for a buffet though) if you look at it as a buffet it's extremely overpriced... if you look at it as a steakhouse it's still overpriced. The quality of the meat was disappointing (for the price I just expected much more) the salad bar is pretty bomb. That was their salvation, but $100 ""all you can eat"" salad bar seems silly. I came twice because so many enjoy it... both times were consistent, consistently bad. Also, the first time I went I had a gift card (which I obviously had never used, and it was mostly spent. . They said ""it happens"" and had a new one send by mail to my house. I definitely would never go back here. If you want a good steak go to ""rare society"".",1.0

Plenty of charcuterie, roasted garlic, pickled onions, mozzarella cheese capreses to choose from. You name it, they've got it;) There were up to 16 cuts of meats to enjoy, but we were way stuffed after 10+ or so cuts. They were kind enough to revisit us for any types of cuts that we loved most.

If you're the type to consume meat, this is the place for you. They have salad bar and a bit of charcuterie. My favorite is their brazilian cheese bread.

598,"I was actually quite disappointed for my first time coming here. They put us in the most uncomfortable seat, which was right next to the restroom, and right next to the table of bowls for soup. My seat was way too close to the table. Less than a feet. Because everyone saw it as a passageway, they would try to schooch themselves behind my seat and knock into me, pull my hair, make me spill my drink, etc. There were large groups of customers AND servers passing through and they would always struggle going through, while making me VERY uncomfortable and honestly it was super ridiculous. The entire experience made me so frustrated.And then our server came by. He was a tall, slightly bald man. He seemed like he was in a rush; when he was pouring our waters, he accidentally dropped our table's biscuits on me. Of course he apologized, but there were biscuit crumbs everywhere on my side and on my lap. Afterwards, while we were waiting for him to come back with our biscuits, a man with meat came by. He was super nice and as he was trying to serve us, our server came back and started asking him in a threatening ""why did you give them the meat?!"" And he just went off on him and made our experience really bad. After the server left, we apologized to the meat man and he said that it's okay and he didn't know why that guy was so upset. For most of the experience, our server was very unresponsive to us. He gave all the other tables much more attention. He didn't take away any of our plates that were building up. He also didn't give us water afterwards. We all had to ration what we had left. We asked for mashed potatoes, but he came back with the fried polenta and fried bananas. That's not what we wanted, we wanted the mashed potatoes only and I made that specifically clear when I told him ONLY. And then no one ate them and it was just sitting there.We got so frustrated and we had to ask another server who was a lot younger to flag down our server, but this new server was actually very nice and considerate! We weren't his table, but he still helped clear our table and get us new plates. He also got us a large portion of mashed potatoes and a new bottle of water for everyone. The dessert was probably my favorite part. The lady who helped us was a such a sweetheart and she was quick too. The portions are large and I love the little additions of fruit for the molten lava cake.  However, when asking for dessert or our check, it was a different server each time. I really don't know where our server went, because he was never there. If it weren't for the nicer servers we found, I would've left a 1-star. The price wasn't worth the service and the frustration that we received that day and I don't know if I'd go back.Update:They give a plain generic apology and ask you to send your phone number and availability, but according to the other Yelp reviewers, no one has reached out to them. This is some really bad customer service and it's a 1-star at this point.",1.0

602,"This 5 star review is specifically because we had a great experience the day before Father's Day w Carolina. To be honest, our last few visits have been super disappointing. Last Father's Day we waited an hour to be seated, in spite of having reservations. The meats were not well organized, we were seated toward the back and had to ask so many times for the cuts of meat we wanted. I had to send my dessert back because the papaya batida was not ripe, it was awful. They did fix it. We decided we were done giving this place chances. But my parents gave us gift certificates for Christmas and so we came again. The only reason it was reasonable was because Carolina took over our table. Listen, the food is good. I'm Brazilian and I very much enjoy several of the dishes. The pao de queijo is more on the greasy side compared to the crispy pao de queijo Im used to and again we had to ask and ask for specific cuts of meat. But the desserts this time we're outstanding and Carolina was attentive, kind, fast and friendly. Try this place at your own risk. Avoid this place at all costs for holidays. Management, please please do something about your reservation practices. Over booking for holidays and making customers wait is gross. Fogo de Chão is supposed to be an outstanding experience and represents Brazil. Please consider how you represent us and do your best. Do better.

I have to say, the service was the best I have seen in any restaurant since the pandemic began. We had a reservation at 6:45pm but ended up getting there much earlier. The hostess told us not to worry she could seat us earlier after she checked for us which was great! Everyone at the restaurant was very attentive, friendly, and helpful. You can tell this particular crew on shift as a whole had a good dynamic and the vibe was very pleasant and positive. I wish I could remember specific names - but honestly I would say every single person we encountered from the front desk to the servers were excellent. I was a hangry pregnant lady...haha...and they definitely could sense it - they made sure I left stuffed...and I was very very stuffed. My boyfriend had never been to the restaurant and he very much loved it. He was happy I took him here for his birthday! On top of the excellent service, the food was very good, all of the steak was delicious.

You have little flip cards on your table so the servers with different cuts of meat can swing by and offer you some if you have the green side up. Red side means not at the moment. I had never been or tried Brazilian food before. It was PHENOMENAL all the meat cuts were juicy and seasoned to perfection. My favorite was the lamb and they brought out a charred cheese with honey. Service was absolutely stellar there was 5-6 people constantly checking in on our table including the meat servers. This place is pricey but 100% worth it. We will definitely be coming back and recommend for everyone to try. My husband and I had the best date night here. Don't forget to bring your appetite!!!",5.0
618,"We booked a reservation on open table for 5:00. We checked in around 4:45 and waited til 5. At five we went up and they told us it could be up to a half hour more wait. We were seated around 5:30. No big deal, but we could've taken our time getting to the restaurant.After being seated, our drink orders were taken. The salad/small bites bar was really good. It's like a full bar with salad, starters, etc. The service to give us meat STARTED good and then tapered off throughout the night. We requested more filet mignon but it took 30+ min and multiple waiters asking us if it had gotten to us just yet when it hadn't. By the time the filet had arrived, we weren't really hungry anymore and just wanted the check. The quality of the meat was alright, some pieces were really fatty and salty. The filet mignon (when it did come around) was probably the best. We were checked on a few times but it felt like waiting to get the check took ages towards the end and we had to flag someone down. The room was super dim so we had a waiter pick up a plate and drop it on the extra empty chair on accident - I felt bad because he seemed super frustrated. Another one tripped over a chair next to our table. One of the waitresses brought around 'valentines shots' on a tray, and we took one thinking it was free with the meal? Tasted along the lines of cough syrup, and when we got the bill, it was an extra 13.50 they tacked on for a shot I had one sip of and put back on the table.  I enjoyed being there with my friends and doing the whole steakhouse atmosphere, but I don't really feel the need to try the experience again.",5.0

We were welcomed with smiles the moment we entered and every person who served us afterwards was a delight.I don't remember names well, but a woman named Andrea came to our table mid way through our meal just to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and answered our questions and made us feel even more at home.

628,"It was the worst business dinner in my history of client business dinners across the country.  We had reservations, we were seated and ignored for too long a period, finally after being approached by a server up selling prepared cocktails and shrimp appetizers.  We were finally approached and given instructions on how the buffet works.  There were no signage at the buffet indicating what the dishes or sauces were, when we asked we were poorly treated.  All the staff with exception of the meat slicers were rude and should not have held jobs that required face time with customers if they didn't want to offer customer service.  To end the evening our bill for $301 arrived, I put out my corporate AX only to have it returned and ran for a different table for $385.  I asked our waiter about the discrepancy and he brought back three closed bills for $301. I asked for the credit slip and he was gone nearly twenty minutes only to return and advise me not to worry about it; he merely edited the amount than canceled it as it would take up to seven days. No apology, no offer to ""make it right, or complimentary dessert; just don't worry it'll be fine."" Not only was it the worst dining experience for me personally, it was a business dinner and a reflection on my business in the eyes of my clients.  I will never return or recommend this location.  We wanted a dining experience, not a disaster!",5.0

Non of the meats was chewable. Had to spit every bite out. We asked for more polenta they promised to bring it. We never got it. Asked again they said in 2 minutes. Nobody brought it not even 1 hour after. We paid a lot for meats that we didn't enjoy not even a bite of. Was very smelly and hard no matter how it was cooked.

632,"First time to a Brazilian steakhouse, and I really enjoyed it. I went with my brother and his family to celebrate my nieces graduation and nephew leaving for the air force.  So I can't speak on the price.  They had reservations for 12 noon on Saturday, we were seated about 20 mins after that, place wasn't too crowded. Hostess explained how things work, and we went to the salad bar.  Not a big selection, but what was there was pretty good.  It took a while for the meats to come out, but when they did, we weren't disappointed.  We had everything from filet mignon to chicken to lamb.  They also serve a side of mash potatoes and cheese biscuits. If they didn't bring out something we wanted, we just asked and they cooked it to our request. The staff were all very nice and attentive.  Also ordered desserts which costs extra, but were good. We all left pretty full.",4.0

634,"Fogo de Chão holds a special place in my heart. The final rating comes with a bit of bias, as the experience last night was a bit underwhelming. My wife made reservations several months ago to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The place is very nice, but like many downtown restaurants, parking is an adventure in itself. I paid for two hours, but after waiting to be seated past our reserved time, and waiting 5-10 minutes on numerous occasions with our green lights prominently displayed at the edge of our tables, it was clear we would have to pay for extra time. The hostess and management was very kind, warm, and impressive handling a busy crowd. The noise was loud and the traffic around our table very busy, which is to be expected.Now, the meats are cooked perfectly. The custodians of meat stop by and ask how you prefer your meat and slice accordingly. If you are picky with that sort of thing and prefer well done or well cooked meats, this place is not for you. Some of these cuts will moo at you and you just have to love it. Truly, I recommend for experts and red meat lovers! To be fair, they will cook anything to your liking, my daughter appreciates her red meats medium well to well done, and they went out of their way to accomdate.Now for the meats and ratings... Picahna (top sirloin prime) 4.5/5Alcatra (top sirloin) 5/5Fraldinha (bottom sirloin) 4.5/5Filet Mignon 4/5Beef Ancho (ribeye) 4/5Ratings with commentary:Chicken Breast 4.5/5 (citrus flavor, greek influence?) Bacon Wrapped Chicken 4.5/5 (salty goodness) Garlic beef 2/5 (forgettable and flavorless) Lamb 4/5 (fatty, minty and tasty) Cordeiro, Lamb Chop 5/5 (this was the best of the bunch, another tribute to greek cuisine.. with brazillian execution) Porterhouse 3.5/5 (a bit rancid tasting.. wierd) Costela, Beef Ribs 3.5/5 (overcooked, but salty and good) Some meats came in bloody and tasting... not so fresh, but overall, the food portion of the experience was a home run. Meat Service 2/5 This was the only bad part, at the Scottsdale location they make you pay a price for having the green card up. In San Diego, I found myself frustrated as some of the servers ignored our table or favored larger groups or less busy areas. This could have been a problem exacerbated by the table location, but given that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, I expected a much better experience. Overall 3.5/5 for the night because of the slow meat delivery, and the fact that the slow service made us have to pay an extra fee for parking. The meat and smiles on wait staff, though, made the delayed service tolerable. Thanks for a memorable night!",4.0
635,"We had reservations at 9pm and were sat by 9:10 (no other people waiting in the lobby). The market table needed some attention--a lot of the food was not available and had not been refilled. This may have been due to the restaurant closing at 10pm, but they continued to seat guests well past that time. Another disappointment is that these meals are typically served with Brazilian cheese bread, mashed potatoes, polenta, and caramelized plantains. We only received the mashed potatoes. Our server had asked if we had been to this restaurant, to which we replied we had not (but we had been to other Brazilian steakhouses). I feel that maybe this is why we were not served the rest of our accoutrements, perhaps our waiter assumed we were unaware of what comes with a typical course. I did not realize until after we had finished, that other tables were served these dishes, otherwise I would have spoken up. Dessert was subpar for the prices, the tres leches tasted like cake flour and the crème brûlée was cold throughout (not freshly torched). Overall, the meat was very fresh, but we were passed several times by the unfriendly gauchos--this became laughable with the couple next to us who had to continuously catch their attention so we wouldn't get skipped again. We travel often, but will not be returning to this location.",2.0

644,"Truthfully, I had such high hopes because Ive had a great experience before l. However, on a Sunday- we ended up paying $65 after calling for a reservation and being told that they have dinner price the whole day which was $45. It wouldn't have been such a disappointment paying for that much if the service was actually good. It was a graduation lunch and they kept walking past us every time they brought out more meats. I would have to ask a server who was coming our way or try to flag someone down just to ask them for more food. They would get it to us after some time, but it was quite a bit. Overall, we probably only tried 5 meats out of the many selections that they had on the menu. We also kept having to wait and flag people down once in a while. Last time I was here, they kept coming us to the point where I had to keep turning them down. My group of 9 all came out of the place still hungry. Definitely the most disappointing thing. It felt like college all over again, expensive and underwhelming.",5.0
645,"I came here with my family during lunch to celebrate my mom's birthday, and we all had a wonderful time. The service was very attentive and friendly. The meats were all super tender, flavorful, and juicy. The salad bar was also very plentiful with lots of different options (loved the beets!), soup, rice, beans. The sides included the cheese bread (so yummy and soft!!! I, myself, had like 6...), mashed potatoes, and plantains. Birthday guests get a free dessert! Let's just say, we left with a full stomach and definitely waddled back to the car.A couple of notes about COVID precautions: - they do try to cohort everyone in the same area to facilitate the servers. However, my older parents were less comfortable sitting closely with other people. The staff were kind and allowed us to find a table farther away from others.- they do have hand sanitizer, masks, and disposable gloves at the salad bar- not all servers were wearing their masks while servingParking: street parking (2 hr max, approx $1/hour) vs parking lots - we lucked out and found street parking nearby.

655,"lol this place is a joke now. DON'T GO HERE. FIND A DIFFERENT BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE. i've been to this location 3-4x. service has declined ever since my first experience. they call it a classy restaurant but don't enforce any sort of dress code. i've seen people with 8-12 year old children and the whole family was in shorts, t-shirts and slippers. but hey, the food was good and the service wasn't terrible so i kept going. i took my parents as a belated xmas gift. they decided to go light on the salad bar so they could save room for the actual meats. unfortunately, the meats barely even came around and when they did, they were overcooked for the temperature they claimed it to be. any other time i went, i could usually wave down a server and get whatever i asked for if it didn't come around. that night, i asked for a certain dish a couple times but it never came. the only things that came around was the dessert menu, desserts, and dessert drinks- which was probably only because they charge extra for those things. by the end of dinner,  i was completely embarrassed because my parents' experience the first time was better than this semi-special occasion. their previous experience was at the irvine location, a year ago. apparently that location isn't as compact as the gaslamp location, even though the irvine location is smaller. i've always thought of this location as being ""intimate"", as in you can't even stretch your arms without touching someone on the table next to you. then my mom said irvine wasn't as compact as gaslamp. my parents were visiting from out of state and were staying in long beach. that means they drove back and forth from long beach, during a storm, just for a lousy dinner in san diego with terrible parking. oh also, this location no longer offers valet. i'm just glad they seemed to be content with their dinner. THE BIGGEST REASON I WILL NEVER RETURN IS BECAUSE THE SERVER TIPPED THEMSELVES AN EXTRA $15+ AFTER WE LEFT. even though the service was subpar, i still tipped close to 20% and rounded the cents so the final charge was a whole dollar. i checked my bank account for something else the next day; that's when i noticed the discrepancy. when i called the restaurant and spoke with a manager, she was mildly sympathetic and the first thing she offered was to refund the entire tip. during the call,  i thought she was getting straight to the point, like i was on the call. then after the call,  i realized that this might NOT be a one-off occurrence. whatever the reason was, I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN OVERCHARGED FOR A TIP WHEN THE ORIGINAL TIP WAS ABOVE THE NATIONAL STANDARD. so fk this place. find someplace else to go to or go to outback where you'll get similar quality steak for WAYY CHEAPER.",3.0

672,"Use to love this place years ago. But the customer service went down hill. The hostess were not welcoming and had a ""I hate my job"" attitude. Our server was though very polite and attentive to us. So that is a plus. Although half of our meats that they cut for us was rare RARE. As though they cooked the outside at super high heat, but everything in the inside was rare. Could not even get a medium rare in some of the meat. In some meat, but not all. Now this did not happened to us, but I feel terrible for the he table next to us. The table next to us was offered mimosas for brunch. A person goes around offering ""PRE-MADE"" mimosas. I can see how a guest would assume that the mimosas were part of the ""ALL YOU CAN EAT"" buffet, like how other brunch restaurants offer mimosas with their brunch menu. But as soon as the bill came out for the table next to use. They were charged 9 mimosas! The man next to us asked the server why was he charged for the mimosas and they told him it was not included in the buffet. In my mind, then why is a person going around with ""PRE-MADE"" mimosas and asking, ""would you like one""? Instead of saying, ""would you like to ORDER a mimosa""? Or at the very least give the person heads up that they are not included in the buffet. The man was furious as his bill came out to $300+. I also witness another table complained about the same thing and the person serving the mimosas said, ""I am just part of the marketing team"". Weird. Luckily we did not get any of the mimosas. It just seem like they lure you in to grab the drink to later find out you are paying for it. In that scenario, a buffet/all you can eat/brunch it would be implied that it is included. As far as the meat service, they went to our table for the first half of dinner, and never came back. I asked for certain meat and was told ""I will tell them to bring it out"". Saw them came out but just FLEW pass our table. It is disappointing that this use to have such great service. I don't know if it is new management or something else. If you do decide to come here, and they offer you something, ask if it is included.",1.0

674,"On Saturday August 5th I was expecting to enjoy my night out with dinner at Fogo de Chão instead it was the complete opposite. Although Saturday nights are extremely busy and I understand that but to sit down for 40+minutes and to only have one server come offer the last fatty piece of lamb he had left, that was the ONLY server who came our way. After asking for the Manager she finally came over when she was good and ready. The manager did nothing whatsoever after I told her we were not getting the experience we came for I kindly offered to pay for the tiny salad I ate while waiting over 40 minutes to be served any type of meat. The manager not once apologized for the way we felt instead she just said I'll be back. She never came back instead she sends the waitress over for the 3rd or 4th time to try and negotiate with us. The icing on the cake was she put a 75$ tap on the table. 75$ for a handful of Greens and a glass of water. If anyone knows customer service that's totally unexceptional. I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone coming to visit me in San Diego!!!!",1.0

My husband ask one of the waiters and she told  us I'm not your waiter.

Noticed there was a lot of open time slots, so I was surprised when we arrived at how crowded it was for a weeknight. Our reservation was for 7:30; however, we didn't get seated until 8:10. They mentioned we could sit at the bar, and we would have if we knew it was going to take 40 minutes to seat us. Maybe remove some of those open times if they can't be accommodated?We are finally seated. Server comes by to greet us. He seems tired and out of breath, but still friendly. We place our orders, including drinks.We are all well into eating our meal before drinks finally come out. Didn't realize it then, but we wouldn't be getting any more drinks until the end of the meal. Throughout the entire meal, we are trying to get the attention of our server for more drinks, but are unsuccessful. We finally grab another worker, explain that we've been trying to order drinks, and order through her. 5 of us place our drink order; out comes 1 drink and its not even the correct one.Finally, at the end of the meal, we explain our situation again to another server who was fantastic, I wish I got her name. She took care of us, recommended some drinks, knocked some off the bill for inconvenience and gave us a celebratory dessert (we were in fact celebrating).

710,"My husband likes steak so I made a reservation two weeks in advance for a party of four for Father's Day. I received a text and a phone call to confirm the reservation the day before. On Father's Day, we paid for parking at a structure across the street. We arrived 20 minutes prior to our reservation time but there was a line out the door JUST TO CHECK IN.We waited 15 minutes just to check in with the hostess and when we did, she informed us that there would be an additional 45 minute wait past our reservation time. What is the point of making restaurant reservations if there was going to be an additional wait? I can understand a delay of a few minutes but 45 minutes after your reservation time is excessive. We had our young kids with us and I knew waiting almost an hour for food would not go over well so we ended up leaving.Thanks for ruining our Father's Day. Before we left, we overheard other diners complaining that their table kept getting ignored and they barely got any food. So I'm glad we left. To anyone thinking of trying this place out, be aware that they either overbook on reservations or have no concept of crowd management or both.",4.0

714,"Having been to several other locations, this particular Fogo experience was by far the worst it was almost comical. It felt short-staffed (seems to be a common theme in these reviews), stuffy, and that there was possibly a shortage of food? In the first hour that my family was seated, we were only approached twice by the gauchos. When they did come by, there would only be offering of over cooked meat and no option of medium rare, followed by long period of no service. This pattern continued through the night. We were a fairly large party, but let it be known we made this reservation well in advance (at least a month, and I confirmed the reservation that morning). It also felt that they crammed us into a smaller table and tried to make it work. This was to the extent that all of our shoulders were basically touching, and to top it off, one of the gauchos gave some attitude that they couldn't get through to rest his meat sword, lol! The final act was when we presented our some gift cards for our bill, the staff on site simply told us ""it didn't go through, sorry"", but after clarifying their validity and requesting to run it a second time, it somehow magically went through. What's up with that. Now our waitress was nice enough to give us complimentary dessert for the troubles as she could tell how terrible our night was (my aunt only complained once), but unfortunately it was a special occasion for my family who came in from several parts of the country. Regret this big mistake to choose this location for Fogo. They need to do some major management changes, or take some notes from other locations because this is definitely not Fogo quality.",5.0

For instance, they would circle around with the picanha, but not go to our table? No idea. Then I saw them circle around with the beef ribs after we requested it 3 times. When they did get to our table they asked us,""how is everything so far?"" I have to say,""Not good"" and their answer was,""we ran out of beef rib and are making a new batch"" I told them, we been asking for it, but we keep getting passed, that's why they ran out before us.I am not sure what the hold up was with this place.To top it off, we did a 3 way split on the bill and they didn't split the subtotal, they split the total price + tax -- then ADDED tax a SECOND time with the split.I do not think it is my job to dissect a bill to make sure it is correct. It's a small amount, I do not want a refund, but I just hope that Fogo will stop with fraudulent business practices such as making people who split checks get taxed twice.

But after a while, we saw other servers brought out bread for their tables.  The steaks were dried, no favor.  We had to flag them down so they come over to our table.  We have been to Fogo numbers of time, and this by far the worst experience ever.  At the end we still gave the guy $60 tips that he didn't deserve!  We are definitely going to Texas De Brazil moving forward.",1.0

We have celebrated our company 10th holiday party and the food and service was impeccable.A huge thanks to Jose, who went out of his way to make sure we had enough to eat. He brought us chicken hearts. Yes! You have to try it. It's amazing!! He was so polite and friendly. He made our experience unforgettable.We were so pleasantly surprised to have the manager Victor to come over and check on us. I wish more restaurants could do the same. Just outstanding!

747,"Michael and his staff Noah, Big Mike, Josh, David and the young lady in the picture I posted are FABULOUS representatives of Fogo de Chao!!! From the door, to your table and throughout the night you will meet the very warm and welcoming staff as they make endless rounds to your table with an amazing variety cuts of meat. Their salad bar and dishes compliment very well with the bbq served at your table. If you want to enjoy a dinner with your significant other or celebrate a special occasion Fogo de Chao is your place! Make sure to call ahead for a reservation and plan for time to obtain parking in downtown.",4.0
748,"So update to my previous review.....The same thing happened tonight only this time we never got a waiter. The host seated us and then said he would get our waiter. Time was passing so I went to serve myself at the bar. My husband asked a server for water and when he brought it, I asked if he knew who our waiter was. He did get someone over to us. This same guy past us and ask if we were ok. I'm not sure if it was miscommunication or what. We went around 1830 and the food bar was not good and the meat service was a bit slow. Maybe staffing issues or somethingNeedless to say management tried to fix our last experience but it was the same on a Thursday night. We have no plans of going back to this location. I will find a new birthday spot.",0.0
749,"I must preface this before I begin. I have been going to Fogo for my birthday for 6 years. 4 years in SD. That's how much I enjoy their food. We also just randomly go or order takeout. So my husband chose to continue the tradition and made reservations for yesterday for my birthday. He did state that it was my bday and asked what were the choices of something special. (I usually make the reservations). They told him.We get seated and no one comes to the table for about 5 minutes. When the guy came he didn't give his name and asked if we've been here before. I said yes. He said so you already know what to do? I said yes. He says you're going to do the full experience? I said yes. He asked our drinks. We said water. He didn't suggest the drink menu like others. Yes I've been here but I expect the service to be the same. We are not paying for drive-thru food. In all of this, the waiter never came back to our table to check on us AT ALL!! He passed by but never stopped to check on us. This is not the experience at the restaurant. So this awesome waiter Freddie came by our table thinking our baby needed something and he was playing with the child at the next table. I advised him we haven't seen our waiter and he did everything he could to try to make me happy. I voiced our concerns. My husband feels like the birthday experience with the dessert was destroyed. (He just want this to go as planned bc he is working on things like this). Had the waiter done a proper introduction he would have known it was my birthday. All in all the food was ok. I didn't get a birthday email this year. Don't know why but ok. I ate my to-go cheesecake when I got home.  I still had a good day. Just wish it were better for my husband.",4.0

756,I have been going to Fogo de Chão often for the past 4 years because of the great food. I pick my favorite locations. By food quality and cleanliness but mostly by customer service. A few days ago I took the wife to eat. I was attended by Carlos/a customer service employee. He was really nice and on point helping us out. I really appreciate the respect & effort given. I could see him being a great role model. Don't ever charge Carlos. Thanks for making our date night a little more special.,5.0

758,"This review is about a month overdue but for our anniversary, my hubby surprised me with a reservation here and I have to say it was an unforgettable first time experience at a Fogo de Chao! While this is the third time that I've ever been to any churrascaria, it definitely made it to the top of my list! The choices of meat were all delightful & cooked to perfection, even the chicken options, which my hubby refused to get full off of since apparently he was there for the ""real meat"" aka the steaks! That being said, I wanted to try a little bit of everything so I got a chance to peek and select from the salad bar which offers a variety of refreshing choices. My only wish was the asparagus wasn't served cold, but the warm cheesy bread and mashed potatoes they serve you makes up for it. A big thank you to our server, Andrea, for the most wonderful service & recommendations! She was very friendly & accommodating throughout our entire dinner. We enjoyed the bottle of wine she brought us as it wasn't too strong and just enough to do the trick. She also recommended one of the indulgent steaks on the menu so we ended up ordering the Wagyu Ancho (Ribeye) & OH MY GOD! I swear I fell in love. It was served on a heated Himalayan salt board (very fancy) and literally melted the saltiness onto the steak then into your mouth. It comes with some chimichurri sauce, but the flavor was exquisite by itself! I still dream about it hehe. To top it all off, we ended our night with a cheesecake in which it came out & read ""Happy Anniversary"" on the plate.. AWWW! Thank you again Andrea for an amazing quality anniversary dinner. I wish I took more pictures of the experience but it's okay because we'll definitely be back soon for more! (:",5.0

762,"I truly cannot even believe the lack of customer service this place has gotten. I work downtown, in the service industry. I get that customer service is hard. We walked up for a walk in for two. It was a Monday night. The restaurant was 70% empty. The two hostesses proceeded to tell us that the restaurant is busy. And because they had already sat a 19 top, all the two tops were pushed together and they could not seat us. There was probably 15ish 4-tops sitting empty. She then proceeded to explain to me what a two top was. I used to recommend this spot to my guests when visiting San Diego. Never again. I can't believe the downhill spill in customer service this spot has experienced.",4.0

764,"Food was decent, the cuts of meat were a hit and miss for me. Some were outstanding and others mediocre. The salad bar was great...tons of variety, quality of food was on par. The experience was definitely not worth the price they're charging. Service was mediocre. Our server left halfway through our meal and never passed us over to another server. Had to ask multiple times for the check and still waited about 20minutes before it finally came. Probably something you do once just to say you did it.",5.0
765,Excellent service with Jose one of the gauchos & Jennifer our server. Enjoyed our dinner service. They were all very attentive to our needs.

766,"We were seated after 20 minutes of waiting which is fine we understood it can be hectic since it's holiday's. After seating down and the server served our drinks. We begun going to the cold buffet. They only a pumpkin soup and beans for the hot food on the bar. Which was disappointing. After 30 minutes of waiting we were only served 4 different meats. Even the other table on the right side we're complaining. I went to 2 servers asking for meat service we waited another 15 minutes and there was still no meat served. Finally the manager approached both tables asking how we are doing we personally said we are not happy after being seated 45 minutes we were only served 4 meats out of the 16 meats. That's when the meat were served but we already lost our appetite. We were there to eat and paid for the meats to be served. Honestly, Rei Do Gado would have been way better and service would have been fantastic. What a waste of money. We were supposed to celebrate a birthday but it was horrible.Poor service, poor food and everything was just unacceptable. Lastly, they charged by card wrong amount which they corrected right away before the server brought back my card and receipt.",3.0

The only thing I would say is the (shrimp cocktail) a gentleman offered and I thought it was part of the deal we got, but we were charged $25 for 6 pieces of shrimp.

My gf and I had walked to smoking gun, had dinner, a few drinks, played some arcade games, and made it home by the time I received a text.

779,Before the pandemic I used to come here often so the other day I was craving for some meat specially picanha so by checking their website I read they have service to go so I decided to try it. I ordered 2 pounds of picanha medium rare unfortunately they overcooked the meat and they give it to you in thick slices. The meat was very tough maybe if they have served it in thin slices as when you dine-in it would have been better or maybe the meat quality was not that good. It was a disappointing experience I think I will need to wait until the pandemic is over to eat here again. So if you aren't afraid of dining -in during pandemic times you should try it but ordering to go is a non starter for me.,3.0

781,"My husband and I decided to come here for our anniversary. Finding parking was a challenge. We had reservations and we were seated in a timely manner. We were seated in the far corner that was dark.  The tables were so close i had to squeeze past other dinners which I'm sure was disruptive but what else was I to do. It was very crowded. The waiter came over we told him we wanted the experience of tasting all the meats.  We went to the salad bar it was messy and low on food. No rice or beans. I got the soup even though I didn't know what kind it was because there was no signs and there wasn't any spoons. This was my first time so I didn't know what to expect. I saw the people walking around with meats but they were bypassing my table in the corner maybe because it was difficult to get in and out of that dark corner. So i flagged down my waiter who was not attentive at all, i asked what do I need to do to get meat for us to try! He said he'd send them over so if i didn't say anything i wouldn't have gotten meats. The potatoes were cold. I guess our waiter forgot about us.  I had to give my husband my water because his glass wasn't being filled. I was very disappointed in the service and food rotation. Then I saw our waiter in his jacket like he was off? Someone else started helping us. He didn't even come over and check on us or tell us someone else would be helping us. For the price it wasn't worth the experience we had. Almost a $200 food bill. I definitely will not be back.",1.0

783,"After a long day at work, I came here to eat because I am familiar with the location in LA. Expecting the same service that i receive at the LA location, I was severely dissatisfied when I sat at the the very empty bar and was not greeted by the 4 bar tenders that were standing behind the bar carrying on with personal conversations about what clubs/bars they were going to after work. I sat there for about 20 minutes waiting to be acknowledged then one bartender said he would be with me in a bit. I waited another 10 minutes (I wasn't even offered water) and decided to go back to the front desk to ask if I could be seated at a table although I was alone. I asked if the kitchen was closing soon, I would like to place a food order before then and I wasn't helped at all at the bar area. The front desk woman was very apologetic and compensated me with a drink and walked me back into the bar. After I finally was able to order my food, the general manager came out and was trying to offer me gift cards for the shitty service and I just didn't want them. I didn't complain because I wanted free plates or drinks or gift cards. I was a paying customer and felt as though I was treated differently because I was a single, young, female. I declined the offer for the gift cards because that is not at all what my motive was. I wanted to be serviced the way a 5 star restaurant should be servicing their guests and it just wasn't it. A special thank you to Carolina, Jake and Hector who went above and beyond to rectify the situation. But other than that, the lame attempt by the GM to get a Yelp review from me by offering me gift cards to apologize, the shitty staff that have no idea what customer service means, this location was just awful. I do not like to complain. I'm very easy going and apologetic but not even a greeting by anyone when I'm sitting there for 20 mins at your empty establishment does not sit well with me. If you expect great customer service at a restaurant, you will not receive that here. And I think there are many other reviews that coincide with how I was treated. An extra shoutout to Carolina, Jake and Hector for taking care of me after realizing I was genuinely upset. I did not want anything for free, I just wanted to be treated like a paying customer and they were the only ones who did that for me. Approach with caution!",1.0

787,"Overall I'd say my experience was 3.5 stars. Ambiance: it's dark inside, and not in a romantic way, more like a depressing way. It's difficult to see your food and the poor lighting brings the mood down. The seats are pretty close to each other so during Covid a little concerning, especially when people don't wear their masks to go to the salad bar area. Food: we went for the all you can eat lunch for $42.95. The salad bar was much smaller than I remember in the past but the food was fresh and well maintained. There was maybe a total of 20-25 options between salads, fruits, vegetables, rice, and bean. They do bring out a side of mashed potatoes, plantains, and polentas to the table, which were good. The meat service was SOOOO slow. We got our first meat after 20 minutes of sitting down and we had to constantly ask our server when the next meat was coming out. We were there for 110 mins and maybe had 7 meat options come by. The best one was the garlic beef cubes, which were tasty and nicely cooked. All the other meats were barely seasoned and VERY RARE and the chicken was so dry and inedible. We had to throw out half of the meat. We ordered soft drinks and it cost a whopping $4.50 for a can. I get the up charge for a restaurant but that just seems ridiculous. Service: overall decent but we had to flag down our server for things like our bill, drink refills, and when the next meat option would come by. Note: come at least 15 mins before your reservation time. We got there right at 1130am when they opened, and there was already 10-15 people waiting to be seated. Kudos to the young male manager who was hustling to get everyone seated asap. Parking: there's a parking structure across the street. It's $1 per hour during the daytime, which is reasonable. It was pretty busy even at 11am so we had to park on the top level. It's a 5 min walk to the restaurant.For the price point and being in the middle of crowded downtown SD, I'm not sure if I would return. I feel like I can get better meat options going to an AYCE Korean bbq place.",5.0

807,"Nov 2020 & it's my 30th birthday. It's Covid, so options are limited.... but on the bright side Biden just won the election. How to celebrate & What to eat in SD? Hmmm let's try Fogo. According to Yelp the customer service is excellent & with a 4 star rating with almost 1800 reviews, wellll you cant go wrong with this joint.First red flag. The only reservation available was for 9:15. The last call is at 10 & that gives you only 45 minutes ish of eating & for $65 a person that really ain't worth it. But anyway we pulled the trigger. We got there early at around 9. After telling the host of our reservation her first response was 'give me 10 minutes' & we were told to wait outside which seemed strange. During that time when she was trying to figure out the reservation, other parties were being let into the restaurant & we kept getting rude looks as we were waiting outside from the host, just felt really off. It's 9:18 & we finally got called in. We were thrown in a corner by a large group of 12. Second red flag. I tried to sit but I was told I couldn't sit at a certain chair because the other parties' kid was sitting on the floor & another kept running & jump kicking the wall. Lovely!! It bummed me out I couldn't sit next to my man & just kinda ruined the mood even more. The meat was definitely disappointing & the meat that was first given out was the best - probably because it was fresh (forget the cut but it was steak & the other was grilled chicken). I loved those but wanted more!! We were offered endless carbs. My man ended up eating fried pineapple for 30 minutes & my carb choice was cheese bread. The next rounds of meat were cold, burnt & not cooked like we requested.Not happy with this place. Service not good & not worth the $65 price tag eating here.",4.0

815,"NOT enjoyable!!! Worst steakhouse I ever came, We are Asian and we felt we were being left alone when we came here tonight for Mother's Day. They did not even give us the round cards for meat service. They served meat to each table but we felt like they skipped our table many times. Why was that!!! Because we are not White??? The whole AYCE meal was just a couple types of meat which kept repeating and not as the menu they listed, not sure they ran out or what!!! Because they called Mother's Day dinner menu but they did not serve what the menu said. They barely stopped by our table, and my kids have to eat mashed potatoes & cheese breads because meat barely served, like every 20-25 mins or took forever to come. Tonight is Mother's Day, also we celebrated our daughter's graduation. Unfortunately, we have made a wrong choice when reserving this place. The only one person that treated us nice was the greeter of our table. Other than that, this place was a worst place we have ever come. A most frustrated dinner night ever at Fogo de Chao, San Diego. This place has ruin everything. WE WILL NEVER RETURN.",1.0

821,"UPDATE: The manager called Rafael reached out to me by phone and email due my bad experience on Valentine's day. He insisted that the experience I had on that day is not what they provide and invited me to come back. I went back Saturday for dinner with my girlfriend and it was the best experience of our lives! First, Rafael made sure we had the traditional Fogo de Chao having all types of steaks. Second, the drinks were great and the server would bring them so quick! The food was very tasteful and the steaks so delicious. It was definitely a different experience than we had before. I talked to Rafael about the previous experience and he said the restaurant had app issues with Open Table app and it happens but I'm glad we came back and had such an AMAZING experience. I can't thank enough the guys would bring the steaks ( José and Patrick), great people that made sure we had the best service as well! Jasmine W our server was so helpful as well.

823,Valentine's day having dinner at this restaurant was a disaster. Had a reservation for 8:30pm but there was a huge line for people who had reservations so we waited. The staff was friendly and doing their best to serve everybody but I guess there were too many people to be served for short of staff. The guys with the steak wouldn't come around too often and the drinks would take 25 minutes to be made. I understand they were busy because of the event but two hours wait for people whi had reservations?they should've put a limit time for people to be sitting and then this wouldn't have happened and maybe hire more people. The staff was fine and doing their best.,5.0

835,"We went for Thanksgiving Dinner and our experience was very underwhelming and disappointing. We had reservations for 6 people and we were seated fairly fast & that was the only good part in this experience and unfortunately everything else was not. Our table was located in a corner. After bringing out our water and drinks, throughout the night, we did not have any server checking up on us to see if we needed water or anything. We kept trying to get all of the servers attention (anyone who walked by our table) to get our water refilled and no one came to our table. My husband finally had to get a pitcher for our table. There was this one server, a young lady who had an attitude when we mentioned that it took forever to get our water refilled.She said to our group ""It's Thanksgiving you know."" and just flat out walked away without asking if we needed anything else or maybe apologize for the delay in service. We got NOTHING from this server but her bad attitude! The kitchen barely kept the salad bar replenished with food, one would think that this business knew ahead of time how many reservations they had and should have accordingly staffed their restaurant and prepared enough food to keep the salad bar filled at all times. I lost count on how many times I walked over to the salad bar only to find empty platters! The rotation of the meats was slow, we got the same type of cuts over and over. We did not get the bone-in ribeye, beef ribs to name a few and no caramelized bananas or cheese bread either. To top it off they tried to add a shrimp cocktail on our bill that we did not order. Needless to say, my family will never come back to this place. Service was beyond horrible.",4.0

838,"Fogo De Chão is a delicious Brazilian BBQ restaurant. My go-to every time I come is the lamb chops cooked medium or medium-rare. Also, they have this delicious corn at the salad bar that is delicious. So the best waitress I have encountered at Fogo is Marina. She is always making sure we have what we need and get the meats we want. with her, as our waitress, we know the service provider will be exceptional. I had a minor issue today but after speaking with Michael Di Iulio felt better about the situation because he listened to my concerns and corrected the issue I had He didn't treat me like a customer who was complaining he treated me like a valued customer. One of the best greeters at the front is Lorraine, she always greets us with a welcoming smile and a welcome back which we love. One thing I will say is it's helpful for the people who bring the meats to know the temperature of the meat (rare, medium-rare, etc.), and also it was kind of warm in there so maybe having the AC on or at least higher would be nice. An honorable mention is Eric. He wasn't our waiter, however, hearing how he was with the man sitting behind us was exceptional. There are a lot more people who deserve a shout out and one who wasn't my favorite but I don't have names. Overall great Fogo experience.",1.0

Marla was great as well. She gave my friend and I some suggestions that were great. Marina is also great. She's always on top of things and provides us with the best service she's is one of the reasons we always come back. I always feel like we are welcomed and everyone is happy to see us. I've been going to Fogo for about 4 years now and I can tell there have been a few changes but the customer service is always wonderful and the food is delicious.

My first time to try.  It takes the servers a long time to drop by your table to offer the good meat. By the time they come by, my wife and I were already full from eating the other stuff.  It is expensive but I thought worth it if we get to eat the good cut meat. But instead they intentionally serve you the good cut meat only once or twice the whole dinner time. I had to get up a few times to ask for the quality meat. Not worth the price you pay.",5.0

846,"Was on a mini vacation away from home with my boyfriend. He's a steak kinda guy. Price: around $55-60 per a person so you better eat your money's worthServer was kind and came every so often to check on our needs. The continuous efforts on up selling did get on my nerves a bit. Boyfriend enjoyed the meat. As he generally loves anything involving a lot of meat. Sirloin was cooked just the way I liked it, medium rare. Didn't like that the pieces we got were the side pieces, I prefer the middle as the ends are more charred. Some of the meat had more fat than I'd expect from a place that charges so much. We were placed in a back corner up against the wall and despite our placards being visible and green side up, we were missed on rotations when the servers who came about with the slabs of meet did their passes.  I made it known to our main server and it helped a bit... but we still did miss out on some. The ""buffet"" area, simple, nice, maybe Brazilian food just isn't to my liking, but a lot of what was offered was just not to my taste. Only liked the smoked salmon and fruit.",5.0

865,"Went during a high peak time yesterday (veterans day, with a bunch of veterans). Waited about an hour for a table. The food at the buffet was alright. Ended up trying to fill up with the buffet as the people with the meats hardly came to our table. I got to sample 3 different meats in the 3 hrs of being there. Our table was literally sharing slices of meats because no one came to our table. Inside was overly crowded, had to squeeze through people to get the bathroom. There were no waiters around to take my plate so I ate on top of a stacked plate. Overall, disappointed as we paid for a meal/experience we did not get. Literally left still hungry.

883,"I was super excited to get to come here. My partner and I went earlier this summer to celebrate the end of another school year. Being a graduate student, I hardly make much money, so getting to treat us to Fogo de Chao was a really big deal. However, I was sorely disappointed and felt that I did not receive the service that I paid so much for.The night we went, the lobby was full and crowded with angry people who had reservations 1-2 hours prior and had yet to be seated. My partner and I were seated an hour after our reservation . At that point it was so close to closing time that we hardly got the experience we paid a ridiculous amount of money for. We felt rushed. Oh! This goes without mentioning that we didn't even have a waitress or waiter. No one brought us bread, no one  came to take our check. It was as if we were invisible. The people around us got bread but we were totally ignored. It took us an eternity to get our check. Finally, a  server came up and asked how we were doing and we expressed dismay about the experience. He said he would bring us dessert on the house. Guess who never came back to the table with dessert? What a waste of my time and my hard-earned money.",5.0

There was a long pause until the next round came (we had to ask for service). The one and only time the filet mignon was brought, it was over cooked and tasted bad. Almost as if it had gone bad and they over cooked it to try and mask the flavor. The service was good, but unfortunately the meat that came around was more sausage and chicken than beef. I don't know that I would be in a hurry to return for the price.",4.0

908,Ask for the price before. Went on a holiday and they charge more. This would be fine if customers are notified BEFORE! The menu outside and online didn't show holiday prices and the waiter did not mention this at all. Not coming back. The food is also mediocre. You could make better bbq/meat at home. Only decent things were the cheese bread and salad bar. The meat was over cooked and chewy. Service was also lacking. Not coming back. There's better places that don't cost as much.,5.0

911,"We went here yesterday 02/12/23 party of 8 around early dinner and our experience was VERY BAD, to start it off the server doesn't look too happy to be working that day then we were asked if we wanna do the full churrascaria experience wich ofcourse we said yes and were excited for it since some of the people in out party is their first time at that restaurant. During the time we were there the restaurant was not busy at all. First, we waited for soo long to get ""some"" of the meat that they are serving and we didn't EVEN get to experience the full menu, we only got about 3 type of meat that they were serving BUT the tables next to us and around us was getting all the service and we had to sit there for soo long for them to even come to us and serve us and why is that? Was there something wrong with our party?? We are all paying customer right? We ask to get some more choices of meat and their words are ""in few minutes"" all the time but never really bothered coming back with our request so we never tasted the other choices of bbq meat that they serve! their salad bar had barely anything on it, then our server we only saw him when we seated and got our water and when we got the check OFCOURSE but while we were there we didnt even got a refill for our drink even we asked the other server but we never got it, honestly the only thing is what the F* kind of service in this restaurant, it was very F* Disappointing!

914,"Words can't even describe my disappointment. I made reservations for 7:45 pm and we had to wait 30mins because 2 walk-ins were there before us (what's the point of a reservation?!?). Once we sat down our server took over 25mins to talk to us. Waited 5 mins for our drinks 1 start star for drink service. The meat servers were all over the place some were happy and some were grumpy but some of them don't know the concept of the cards which made no sense. Our side dishes took over 30mins to arrive since they were backed up in the kitchen. My bf asked for the check and our main server mentioned a complimentary dessert for his bday. I said yes. The server brings the check. I'm still drinking my glass of wine. The bill is paid and still no dessert. The server asks for the check (very strange and rude) Waited about 15mins and still had no dessert. Finished my glass of wine and just left. HORRIBLE experience since I just wanted to celebrate his bday before he left for deployment. San Diego Fogo De Chao was a huge disappointment especially since I usually go to the one in Irvine and Beverly Hills. It really needs a facelift and new staff. The staff looked like they work at Dennys instead of a steakhouse. The manager dressed as if he worked at motel 6. Honestly, it was just horrible. Did not give me a steakhouse atmosphere. It was a rundown steakhouse. The food was great but overall a huge disappointment. Will NOT return to this Fogo De. Chao.",1.0

926,"* We called ahead and booked a reservation for seven guests for outdoor seating, after being assured that we were going to be offered the same service after the hostess had confirmed with their manager. We were then told that the space heaters had been stolen the week prior, but decided to go anyway, because the weather was slightly brisk, but our reservation had already been made. When we arrived, no table was ready for outdoor seating, we were then informed that the servers would not be servicing the outdoor seating area, and were shoved into a corner with a round table.* The servers frequently had trouble maneuvering around the table because of how packed the floor layout was. Our table had a single red/green disc, instead of one per guest, and the servers repeatedly had to ask who would like to be served, but had trouble hearing.* When we arrived there was an option to purchase the emerald package, and I had left the hostess with my card to pay for the emerald package and to open a tab with the bar for any drinks not covered by the emerald package. The card was returned to me without a word, and I was worried because they had not acquired a signature, but they had informed one of my friends that the card was already charged. I went back to confirm with the hostess whether the card had been charged, she then said they were under the impression that I had not wanted to pay the required 18% gratuity, which was simply not true, because no one had spoken to me. The hostess had assured me that there was a communication issue, and told me that they could charge me for the emerald package, so I handed her my card again, and some short time later, a server had come by to let us know that we would instead be charged at the end of the night, and without reading the name on the card, then handed it to the friend for whom we were hosting the dinner.* Several cuts throughout the night were overcooked and rough, or raw and chewy, but the server had introduced one of the earlier cuts as ""seasonal pork"", and it was liked by everyone at our table unanimously. At the end of the evening, we had tried to order it before closing out the bill, we were then told that no such cut was served, despite every other people at our table being told the same thing.* At the end of the night, we had wanted a photo to commemorate the occassion, and one of the waiters jokingly posed in front of the camera, and became a blur on the photo.If the service could neither be described as negligent, nor incompetent, it could only be malicious.",5.0

937,"Absolutely the worst dining experience of my life. I've never walked out of a restaurant, but there was no way I was going to sit there and have them ruin Mother's Day. Started with a rude hostess yelling at people and telling everyone that reservation didn't mean anything. Everyone was herded like cattle outside the restaurant since nazi lady wouldn't let anyone in the door. She also refused to give anyone a time frame or place I'm line because she ""didn't want to be yelled at"". 30 minute after our reservation time, we were led to a back room where the hostess said our table was given away so she needed to find us another. Finally seated at a table, we found zero place settings... there weren't even the discs. We finally got some water after a bit, so we headed to the salad bar where we were greeted with some Caesar salad and beef jerky-looking salami. Everything had, of course, been picked through. Picking at our ""salads"", we were ignored by the few gauchos that were around. 30 minutes and not one gaucho came by our table despite us trying to flag them down. One server finally came to us and apologized saying that she had to beg the gauchos to pay attention to her family that was sitting at the table next to us. We've been to several Fogo's over the years, and have always enjoyed our experiences... even during the first opening month for the El Segundo location. We will never ever return to the Gaslamp Fogo and suggest no one else for either. Rei Do Gado around the corner saved the day.

951,"To celebrate another revolution around the sun, my family and I decided to eat at one of two places in San Diego I had been yearning to eat at for many years.  There are two popular Brazilian BBQ places in San Diego, Rei de Gado and Fogo de Chao, with both serving unlimited meat and other side dishes.  I chose Fogo de Chao for our first  San Diego Brazilian BBQ experience because both my brothers said positive things about Fogo and they were right.Fogo is located on 6th Avenue in the heart of downtown San Diego.  It's located next to Parfait Bakery, diagonal from a Buca di Beppo Italian restaurant and a Comfort Inn, and across the street from an Ace hardware store.  Conveniently, there is a public parking structure across the street where they charge $1/hr, which surprised me considering how expensive it is to park in Downtown.  The outside of the restaurant was brick and the entrance gave off the appearance that we were about to dine in a ritzy restaurant.  That appearance was immediately realized as you stepped inside Fogo.  Fogo is definitely a pricey all-you-can-eat establishment, but the inside vibe and ambience justifies it.  It's a fine dining buffet with tan, autumn, red, and black color scheme.  The light fixtures, brick facade, giant wooden barrels, and Western influenced artwork add to Fogo's classiness.  The meat servers and staff were smartly dressed.  I've got to specifically commend two meat servers, Monica and Ayerton, for stellar customer service, personalizing our dining experience, and for making our first time visit a memorable one.If you've never been to a Brazilian BBQ restaurant, let me quickly explain what to expect and give you advice.  There will be servers carrying different types of meats and other types of food where they will slice pieces of meats for you to grab with provided tongs.  This is a carnivore's dream and I guarantee you will get the meat sweats because there will be an abundant amount of meat.  On your table you will have a cardboard coaster that will have the color red on one side and green on the other side.  Green means keep the meats coming while red means, ""Hold up, wait a minute, let me eat this food for a minute.""  Here at Fogo there is a buffet line of cold dishes, salads, fruit, and another station where waffles and omelettes were made to order.  Besides the endless amount of meat and the buffet line, you will also be served side appetizers.  Try everything, but eat minimally from the buffet line and the other complementary dishes that are designed to make you full.  Save as much room for the tender, delicious, and savory meats.  While we were there, I was told there were 16 cuts of meats, so I'm not sure if I tasted everything, but my sole purpose was to get my money's worth.  Mission Accomplished!Fogo de Chao is not for the budget friendly, but I believe the $43 lunch price was well worth it for the scrumptious meats and side dishes, the noteworthy customer service, and just the experience of eating to your heart's content.  I recommend eating at Fogo's for lunch because it's cheaper and it's less crowded.  For my 51st birthday, the meat sweats garnered from my delish culinary adventure at Fogo made for a memorable celebration.",4.0

I understand they were probably short staffed with the holiday, but there was little to no customer service the entire night. An apology goes a long way with a night like this.

957,"*** Review for their $43.95 AYCE Sunday Brunch during pandemic ***Overall experience was 3.5 stars.There is no longer a self serve salad bar with their bountiful spread. Staff now brings around salad bar items and serve it to each patron. The meats are also now served in the same manner. There is currently outdoor patio seating and they have utilized additional sidewalk space to host more tables.We had a reservation and requested a shaded table but that wasn't available as they gave all those tables away by the time we arrived early. So we had to an unexpected wait for a table that visit. I've posted enough photos of past visits (and will post pics of this visit) but here is a summary of the Brunch AYCE visit:- make a reservation via OpenTable and call ahead to make sure they secure a shaded table (if you don't like sun)- study the brunch menu as no menu was given to us when seated. I am not sure if they assumed no one would request items or would be satisfied with what was being served.- you can request the doneness of the meats (it might take longer but it's worth the wait)- coca cola was served in a small bottle for $3.75, so no free refills- not all the Brunch Salad options were fulfilled or offered such as 'made to order omelettes' and  Braised Beef Rib Hash- we did ask for a meat menu at one point as the same meats were being served over and over. We regret not asking for more pork items (pork picanha, sausage, loin, etc), ribeye, and anything bacon wrapped. - Remember to request for items you do not see being offered AND/OR ask for the menu- don't fill up on the salad bar items. Be cautious of how much you try before the meats start arriving or before you request meat items- desserts/sodas/coffee are not included in the meal  - be patient as it takes time when you request certain cuts of meats at a desired doneness- the caramelized bananas and grilled cheese with honey can make for excellent dessert options at end of meal- bill is presented on an electronic tablet where you pay and tip at table. You can also split the check on the tablet as well (not sure if you can split multiple ways as only one card was used that visit)** Did I think the $43.95 was worth it per person for an AYCE Brazilian BBQ during the pandemic **Yes and No. I would have easily spent less had I ordered a la carte as I didn't eat all that much that visit (and I went on an empty stomach). The meats came out slowly while the salad bar items could fill you up before you could enjoy the meats. My guests felt it was a nice price for what was served (but then again they didn't pay and they also enjoyed a la carte desserts/drinks/cappuccinos). For me, the $43.95 was spent on the ambiance and time shared with close friends.my food blog has more detailed review and brunch picsService improved throughout the meal. The staff here seems to work as a team and are trying to adjust, just like customers, to this new style of eating out. For that, I'm giving them four stars.",4.0
958,"It pains me to give Fogo de Chao only 3 stars but I think it's a proper rating after paying $51.95 per person for a dinner we recently had there. I treated a friend to a birthday dinner here as he's been wanting to visit this Brazilian steakhouse for ages (mostly due to me praising how much I love this place).The salad bar seemed to have less offerings than what I remembered from two years ago. Perhaps it was just dark that evening (my prior meals here have been during the day time).  My favorite items at the salad bar were:- prosciutto- brown sugar chili bacon- tabbouleh - jumbo asparagus Brazilian meats we tried:- FRANGO Chicken: tasted a bit dry and salty- PICANHA Prime Part of the Top Sirloin: nice rareness but too salty- FILET MIGNON Beef Tenderloin: covered with yummy garlic but filet was dry- LINGUIÇA Pork Sausage- BEEF ANCHO Rib Eye: nice & rare but too salty- COSTELA DE PORCO Pork Ribs: bone in ribs- CORDEIRO Lamb- FRALDINHA Bottom Sirloin: best skewer of the night and not overly salted- PORK CHOP: too dryHot table appetizers:- caramelized bananas : just brilliantly roasted and delicious- garlic mashed potatoes - polenta: like fancy, thick, crispy french fries sprinkled with parm cheeseDon't be bashful to ask the server for their house made sauces:- bbq (or their house A1?)- horseradish- chimichurri- salsa- mint sauceService was kind and we appreciated how they let the birthday guest pick out his own (surprise) birthday dessert compliments of the house. That was greatly appreciated. The ambiance and experience here at Fogo de Chao is special and memorable. The presentation and delivery of the meats is pretty cool if you've never been to a Brazilian steak house. But the $51.95 per person price tag is hefty. Especially when the meats that evening were all generally over seasoned. Make note that the AYCE salad-only dinner option is priced at $28.50. That AYCE option has cold cut meats plus the yummy brown sugar bacon (and the 3 hot sides served to table). So I think I would have been A-ok with the salad only choice that night as I seemed to enjoy the salad bar more than the meats. My friend enjoyed the meal and had a fantastic time so that's all that mattered to me that evening. Mission accomplished (giving him a memorable bday dinner) so there ya go.",3.0
959,"Shhhhhhh!!! Biggest kept secret of 2014 (well, maybe not, but it's still a cool deal)...Restaurant Week is coming up and you can have an AYCE lunch here for only $20 buckoroos. A few key things that you can thank me later for: (Trust me, I've researched & researched & obsessed & obsessed about the following)....- Restaurant week is Jan 19-24. Fogo only serves lunch Mon-Fri so make sure you book for Jan 24th lunch for the $20 RW deal- Fogo is extending their Restaurant Week to Jan 26-31 (yessss!!!) so make sure to book the lunch deal for Jan 31st (Friday)- I thought they were serving the same stuff at lunch and dinner but I was wrong. I actually counted the protein items like a freak and compared to their dinner counterpart. - The lunch menu only has 9 meats, dinner has 11 meats (lunch doesn't include Filet Mignon and Costela which is the beef ribs). - Dinner also includes dessert .Lunch still is a steal at $20 even if it doesn't have the filet and beef ribs. So plan ahead. Even the $45 dinner deal during Restaurant Week isn't too shabby since it includes a slice of cake that I'm sure our fat a**es don't need (oh...did I just say that last part out loud...my bad....)Happy 2014 AYCE eating my dear yelpers...",5.0

Those words gave me shivers every time I heard them growing up in church.Well...I inadvertently sinned last Saturday at Fogo de Chao...And it was sooooo good (the FOOD, not the actually sinning...right?).Yes, I attended the yelp event where Fogo and Yelp graciously hosted a bunch of hungry, ravenous Yelpers. Yes, I took advantage of every single item that was offered in their unbelievable salad bar.Yes, I had meat drippings all over my clothes from trying to consume all the skewers that were offered that day.Yes, I snuggled and caressed their infamous Pão de queijo (warm cheese bread) like a weirdo Fogo de Chao San Diego will be a force to be reckon with. I don't usually cheer for the Goliath of most chains but I humbly concede that Fogo is worth every penny that you spend here. (I've been to their location in Beverly Hills and didn't like it at all).The service:- impeccable, attentive- dressed so professionally and cute (kinda like Hooters but without the inappropriate butt cheeks hanging out, you what I'm saying).Drinks:- CaipirinhaI don't know what's in this as no one told me but after googling it, it seems there's lime, sugar, Cachaça , and ice. It says you can replace the Cachaça with rum or vodka. It tasted really good though - just too sweet for my taste.- Fogo de Chao 2011 MalbecThis is their red wine that has their Fogo name on it. I liked it quite a bit and felt it went really well with all the food we had that afternoonSalad Bar:- 24 Month, Aged Parmesan- Aged Manchego Cheese- Prosciutto- Brazilian Hearts of Palm- Artichoke Bottoms- Sun-Dried Tomatoes- Fresh Mozzarella- Smoked Salmon- Italian Salami- Jumbo Asparagus- Tabbouleh-Shitake Mushrooms- BOWL OF FRIED BACON!!! (see pic)Everything was presented BEYOND beautiful at the salad bar. I don't remember one particular thing that I loved the most as I was saving room for all the meats. BUT, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, at the salad bar was fresh and impeccable.Food:- Picanha (prime cut of top sirloin): My FAVORITE!!!- Filet Mignon (two ways - can be wrapped in bacon): get the one slathered in garlic- Beef Ancho (prime part of the rib eye): yumz- Alcatra (special cut of top sirloin)- Fraldinha (bottom sirloin): REALLY GOOD! Get it med rare- Costela (juicy beef ribs)- Cordeiro (fresh lamb): Came out piping hot- Frango (chicken, two different ways): Try the one wrapped in bacon- Costela De Porco (baby back pork ribs): delicious and not dry- Lombo (pork loin encrusted in Parmesan cheese): definitely has LOTS of parm- Linguica (cured pork sausage): too full to remember Sides:- garlic mashed potatoes, crispy hot polenta, and caramelized bananas: the bananas were THE best.I had to get up at one point to give my stomach a break so I started to wander around the restaurant a bit. Samir, one of the managers, saw me looking at their wine and gave me tour of their amazing glass wine room. He was incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and gracious - this man knows his wine. And he showed me their $3,020 bottle of a 1990 Chateau something ( that's three thousand twenty dollars and 00/100 cents, folks.) They have an extensive selection of vino so for those of you that love wine (paired with great meats), this really is the place to try.For those of you who have vegetarian friends, you can share a meal w/ them here because the salad bar has more options than the meats served (and the salad bar option is cheaper as well).When I texted the pics of the food to my best friend in LA, even *she* said she wanted to try it out now and BELIEVE me when I say that SHE is the Cheapo of all Cheapos (a thousand times worse than me...shocker...I know).Thank you Yelp and Fogo de Chao",5.0

962,"Visited Fogo de Chao for our anniversary as part of a long weekend trip to San Diego. This was our first time to a Brazilian Steakhouse. My husband and I do not like buffets but we wanted to try the Brazilian Steakhouse experience and I'm glad we did. The staff were all super helpful and very kind! I would say it's sone of the best service we experienced while in San Diego. The drinks were reasonably priced. We each had a speciality cocktail (pineapple old fashioned and the Strawberry Hibiscus Caipirinha and then three glasses of Malbec. We received a complimentary dessert for our anniversary, which was very nice. As part of the parade of meats, there was a hot cheese with honey course that came around...out of this world cheese! I know this experience is supposed to be about the meats (which were all delicious), the cheese and honey course was a real standout. Great experience, would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to experience a Brazilian Steakhouse.",0.0

964,"Truly the worst customer service I've ever experienced, everything started off great until our waiter (blonde girl didn't catch her name) told us our id's were fake. We are from texas my wife and I live in California and our family was visiting us. She got the manager to look at our id's and he's the one who had said they were fake but indeed they were not (maybe if they trained better we wouldn't have had this problem), I would've been okay without the drinks but the manager just made in impossible for that and ruined our appetite with the way he was handling things. I will be calling corporate and talk to them further about it because leaving the place in tears from the manager's incompetence was not how I would've liked our family dinner to have gone.",5.0

Our favorites were the Beef Rib and the House Special. All the staff were very helpful and at our service for any of our needs. And a special shout out to Yesenia, Christian, and Kelly who went above and beyond to make this experience great! The only downside is they don't tell you the price before you try something or make you aware of the price difference between lunch and dinner. We didn't know dinner started at 2:30PM and so instead of paying $40 per person we paid $60 per person. Though other than this it was still a wonderful experience and we would come back.

973,"This used to be one of my favorite spots but man the service today was absolute garbage. For a steak house, I waited 40 minutes since I sat and only 3 people walked by and offered me food. None of those options by the way were steak. A piece of chicken, a piece of cheese?, and a piece of pineapple. In 40 minutes. Yes, they were busy but it wasn't because of that. They had plenty of food runners with meat run by but no one stopped, even when asked they ignored and kept going.When I complained to the manager a couple of guys came by with some overcooked dried-out steak which was it for me. I was done, so I asked for the check and the server overcharged me and added a bunch of drinks to my ticket. I had 1 drink, which he replaced without me even asking but I drank it so I was okay with paying for 2 but they charged me for 5 drinks. The manager tried to apologize and instead of discounting my ticket, he gave me a gift card that was set to expire in literally 3 days. What a shit show, why would I ever come back after that? Especially in 3 days.",5.0

982,"A truly disappointing experience. I went to Rei Do Gado in the past and I liked all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse style. So we decided we will go to another one for a bday dinner. We booked for 5 people in Fogo de Chao.  The all you can eat menu is $63.99 per person which is pretty expensive so the expectation was quite high. Here is my experience: The place is big enough but they crammed in way too many tables, so it is very crowded. Compared to the number of tables, they have only 3-4 servers. No meat servers came to our table for a long time and then they disappeared for the entire time. So we had to keep asking where is meat?  They will reassure you multiple times that servers will come but that doesn't happen.  Not sure it's on purpose or because there weren't enough servers.We had to wait 30 mins to lamb to come to our table. So in short, very limited frequency for meat even if it is supposed to be all about meat in a Brazilian Steakhouse. The meat those came to our table at last were good most part, specially the lamb. However, they didn't bring all the meat that were listed in All You Can Eat menu. Only 4-5 types of meat came. Salad bar was OK but not great. It's just some random stuff where they put together different ingredients without any thought. At the end of the dinner, it didn't worth the price paid and was felt total rip off. Oh also, parking is terrible in the area. Not the issue of the restaurant but usual downtown problem. So you might need to park couple blocks away and walk like 10-15 mins. Here what they should consider to make the place worth going: -Reduce the number of tables or increase the number of servers. -Get the meat more frequently in the table. -Be more observant which tables need meat. -If you can't do any of these, reduce the price by half. Until then I am out chief! Adios!",5.0

986,Celebrated our anniversary here! First time for me here and I enjoyed every piece of food! We got the full experience for two. All the meats we tried were delicious but the sirloins (top and bottom) and both lamp chops and lamp steaks were bomb! The mashed potatoes are good too. And the plantains and pineapples are addicting!! Service was great! Didn't have to wait for any food. Every staff was nice as well. Had a great time. Spent about 170 including tip!

987,"It was my partner's and I's first time coming to Foca de Chão, we were celebrating my birthday in March and it was supposed to be very romantic and intimate and while we got in with our reservations no problem and the majority of the staff was amazing and the food was great, I keep thinking of a moment that really makes me think twice about coming here again for special events. Our main waitress, a woman with a beautiful accent and was extremely sweet was checking up on us as well as the rest of the staff who made us feel welcome and immersed. Mid-way through dinner after everyone made a round of making sure we were okay my partner was giving me a special gift and we were having a private moment, Our primary waitress and the other staff noticed and gave us space, catching the ""hint"" that we were having a moment, But there was a waitress in particular that came over despite clearly seeing the situation, asked if we needed anything so we put a pause and said no thank you and then despite looking at the gift box at the table and the situation we were in, then hovered  a bit longer than I feel was appropriate despite our answer of being fine. It's important to note that multiple people, including our main waitress gave us our moment, but this waitress who was very young did not catch the hint at all. I really appreciated the service and the amazing staff, honestly the experience would have been 10/10, I use to be a server myself so I understand how hard everyone works and I greatly appreciated the other waiters/ waitresses for their hard work especially giving the time to make sure newcomers felt welcome that was 10/10, My birthday was still special, I still loved my gift and I did have a beautiful moment. But I'm leaving this review not because I had issues with the food or anything severe but if our reservation notes said that we were a couple having a special birthday and it's clear from every angle that we are about to have a private moment to the point where other tables were observing the situation and every other waiter including our primary waitress noticed and gave us space (thank you) I felt the way this young waitress checked in on us was inappropriate for the situation as our cards were red, food was still being worked on, drinks were full and other people had checked in on us, and she lingered even after her question was answered. This place isn't cheap and they promote the ""ambiance"" of the area which is great but with certain staff ""killing the mood"" so to speak I would think about coming here again for special events.",3.0

998,"This less than great review is stemming directly from last night, Thanksgiving. We made reservations for 7:30 and arrived a few minutes before. It was packed out with people just standing around and waiting for their reservations. When we checked in she told us it would be around 30 minute wait even with a reservation. We soon learned it was going to be much longer as people from 6:00 still hadn't been seated. The host at the check-in was trying very hard to keep order and be organized while the woman seating people was literally just raffling off tables at this point. 2 top?! 4 top?! 3 top?! At one point someone just walked up from the back of the line and she sat them, no rhyme or reason. We got sat before people who were there hours before us because we were only 2 people and they couldn't accommodate the larger groups. When we finally got sat, majority of the stuff at the sides/salad bar were empty and I feel like half of the meat didn't even come to our table. The same 2 or 3 things kept coming around while other things we NEVER saw. Our server couldn't be bothered with us at all. She went to the tables around us multiple times and then would just glance at us and leave the area. We had to flag her down for basic stuff and finally just started asking other people because she was nowhere to be found and never came back. We've been here before and this was definitely the worse experience we've had. We've been here on busier nights and still received great service.

Perfect balance between melty fat and succulent meat. Flavor, also on point. The salad bar was also tasty with things like the Fall Lentil soup, beets, cheese, and cold cuts made for great starters. Minus one star for them no longer having the roasted pineapple. The sweet and tangy pineapple would have balanced the salty and savory meat beautifully.

1013,"Honestly, I was SO excited to come here because I hadn't been to any Fogo location since pre-pandemic times. I even Ubered from my hotel to downtown for the sole purpose of dining at Fogo. However, my experience was less than impressive.I was solo dining and requested a table for one at 12pm on a Wednesday. The hosts led me to a small table tucked in the corner of the restaurant. My server opened with the usual small talk questions like how my day was going and if I've been to Fogo before. Then he asked me if I spoke Japanese... which was definitely a bizarre question to ask an Asian person, especially if nothing about them indicates they're from Japan (it's not like I was wearing a kimono or anime merch or anything). So I laughed and said no (and mind you, I'm also not Japanese) and asked if he could, but he said no as well. Then he assumed I was there for the churrascaria experience, but I had to correct him by saying I only wanted the Market Table and an order of picanha. He asked me again if I wanted the churrascaria experience, but I repeated what I said about wanting the Market Table and picanha. He finally relented and commented that I must not be very hungry, and left my table. The encounter was seriously awkward and I kinda lost my appetite at that point.Regardless, I still tried to enjoy myself with DIY charcuterie and the selection of veggies. I ended up getting only two plates of food from the Market Table and had my Guaraná Antarctica and picanha (the meat carvers were really kind and never forgot about me despite my being situated in the corner of the restaurant). I'm glad I didn't end up getting the full churrascaria experience because I wouldn't have eaten my money's worth.Anyway, I still ended up tipping 20% because the meat carvers were really awesome, and I almost always do when dining in (when I experience horrendous service, the lowest I ever tip is 18%). I'll still probably visit Fogo in the future, but definitely not this location again.",2.0

1017,"Our experience for lunch today was...underwhelming. I'll start with the good. There was an awesome server named Armando, he was not our assigned server. He was exceptional with our daughter who has cerebral palsy. Every time he walked by, he stopped and made eye contact with her and spoke to her. She loved him! She's non verbal but had eyes on him whenever he was in the room, and was so happy when he would come speak to her. Many people are nervous around kids with special needs, so it really means a lot when people engage directly with her. Armando was the best part of our experience.Now to the not great. We had a large party (13), but an easy group, there to celebrate my husband earning his black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. The server assigned to our table was hardly around. I had to wave him down and ask for everything. No plates were picked up until like an hour and 15 min of us being there until I hunted him down and asked. Repeat the wave down and ask for literally anything we needed: drinks, dessert, the check. He was like a ghost. The salad bar was 75% empty and there were no plates. I had to hunt someone down and ask for those. When I had said plate, there was very little to put on it. It took quite sometime for us to start getting served meats. When they did start coming around, they had served every other table in the establishment and there would only be enough for 1 or 2 people at our table. This happened repeatedly, and they usually wouldn't return for a while. Our group spent over $600 and it felt like we had to all of the work. Again, with the exception of Armando, who was stellar, the whole experience was sub par. Definitely won't be going back.",0.0

1022,"To start off,  I never write reviews and usually enjoy most experiences at any average restaurant.  We chose to visit this restaurant during our visit and made reservations months in advance based on our experience at the Portland, OR location.   The food was good, but the market table was quite small based on my other experience, and most of the meat was dry with a lack of variety.   The service was horrible and after paying $200 for a meal, we are extremely disappointed in what we received. The waitresses weren't consistent and lacked communication with one another.  They didn't know who was assigned to serve which table.  Then they tried to charge us for 4 adult dinners when we only had 2 adults and a child at our table the entire time.  They waitresses were short with us and barely provided any service.  One even acted as though we bothered them by asking for straws and water.",5.0

1025,"I did the full experience and I thought the food was delicious so I was happy about that. Despite this I have two complaints I would like to talk about. One, our waitress for the day was not very attentive and we had to ask other bus boys and waiters for what we needed because she was not around and did not come up to our table. Not only that but when we did ask for items from her such as a Diet Coke and a straw, she never came around after thirty minutes which then forced us to ask someone else. The second complaint I had was there was not enough meat circling around and coming to our table. We informed someone of this because the meat would be gone before getting to our table. Eventually, Mike the Chicken Guy came around with a full serving of untouched meat for us and was very apologetic for the service. He explained that they were severely understaffed and that multiple people called out today. We understood and my dad felt bad for the guy since you could hear how sorry he was and how stressed he was in his voice. We were grateful for him because after he came, we noticed a lot more meat circling and coming to our table. Overall, I just wish our waitress was more attentive towards us and didn't forget our requests multiple times even though she rarely came around to ask what we needed.The only two things that carried my review and rating were the food quality as well as Mike the Chicken Guy.",4.0

1027,"We made our reservations ahead of time thru open table and we waited at least another 15 minutes past our reservation time. Once we got seated though our server was very attentive and quick, the steak came super fast for the first 45 minutes we got seated and then slowed down a bit . We did get really stuffed and the food was good! They offer military discount. Parking is not that easy since it's in the gas lamp area. All in all it was a good experience. I just wish they also didn't ran out of that happy hour wine. There are also other server that comes with a tray of either shrimp cocktail or some dessert alcohol, you do need to pay extra for it. If it's your first time I would suggest doing the full experience and go to the buffet station plus the meat instead of doing a La carte.",4.0

1032,During covid time Fogo de Chao carry out the meats to your table already cut. They don't have the green and red pads system on the table anymore. One of the waiters kinda tricked us if we wanted to order the premium or regular menu and we thought it was like Korean bbq menu where there's premium meats. Turned out that the premium (wagyu and tomahawk) total cost was $130 were separate bill and you still have to pay the individual person for all you can eat. Nevertheless the food were still delicious and the old fashion was one of the beat old fashion I've ever drank.

I went back to the check in counter around 7:30 pm and was told we would be the next. But we were not next. We were not seated and had to wait for additional 15 min until I complained the service manager directly. It looked like she ignored the reservation and served the party near the entrance as she just called any 2, 4, and 6 party here? Some 2 person was seated before the check in while there were many 2 waiting because they were near the entrance. After seated, there was less food for salads bar. The meat was below our expectation.

1047,"Fogo de Chao is by far the best Brazilian Restaurant I have ever been to. On this visit, we attended my nephews graduation lunch. We were seated in one of the private rooms. Nice big space with decor matching the rest of the restaurant. Unique light fixtures, dark wood panels and different decorative tiles creating a kind of sophisticated atmosphere. Enough on that, I don't know much about decor and stuff like that...I'm here for the food. For the first timers. You have a disc placed in front of you. One side is green, the other side is red. Green means bring the meats. The red means you give up. So first you go to the buffet where you pick your sides. They have salads, roasted vegetables, cous cous, cheeses, fruits and breads. After you return to your seat, the parade of meat begins. Each server comes by your table and offers you meat on a sword. They have a variety of meats that rotate around the restaurant. I forget the Brazilian names, but they range from garlic sirloin, to bacon wrapped steak and chicken to a spicy sausage, filet mignon, lamb and their specialty Picanha. Everything is delicious. When they offer you a slice. Just say yes and use those tongs and grab a piece of grilled perfection. You can ask for the doneness of the steak. They will cut it from certain sections to give you your preferred slice. I was really amazed at how you can ask for a medium rare cut and still get a little bit of that charred edge. The best of both worlds. Everything I tried was seasoned nicely and grilled to perfection. Do yourself a favor and ask for a side of chimichurri sauce...you won't regret it. They also bring mashed potatoes, fried polenta, a sautéed banana and some bread to each table. All the sides are good. The polenta is crunchy on the exterior and soft on the inside. The bread was warm and freshly baked. It's not your ordinary roll. The mashed potatoes are a must when eating all the different steaks. It just accompanies it so well. The servers are all friendly and generous with their cuts. They help explain what they have and quickly share a slice with anyone who asks. Near the end of your meal, I like when they ask you if you wanted or missed a certain item. They happily bring it out for you. I would give Fogo de Chao 6 stars if I could. Always a great experience. Always great food.",4.0

1049,"We had 5pm reservations and arrived at 4:50 to check in. I was told we would be seated in a few minutes. I asked again the status of our reservation at 5:15 and they told me they would seat us in a few minutes. At 5:30, we had to show our text that open table stated that we should be seated by now in order to be seated. Our waitress, Kelly, was very pleasant and friendly. She got our drink orders and an extra glass of water and told us to help ourselves with the salad bar. The salad bar was delicious. Everything there was fresh. You can taste the high quality prosciutto and salmon. The first 30 minutes were great because we actually had servers come to our table with different selection of meat. Mostly the inexpensive cuts. Then there was a period where we waited for 20 minutes with no server coming to serve us meat. We had a busboy who took our plates and he accidentally dropped a plate onto our table, but he apologized and I don't blame him since the lighting wasn't that great. He asked if we needed anything and I told him we wanted more food. Requesting the filet mignon and the rib eye which this restaurant was known for. Took them 15 to 20 minutes to get to us with the cut and then the no meat service happened again. For $70/person, one would expect a constant flow of service that the restaurant advertised, but waiting so long for the meat servers to actually serve you was the turn off of this experience. Kelly was great. The salad bar was great. The meat was decent. I wish I had more but we went out to eat something else afterwards. This is why I gave the 3 stars. Kelly. Salad bar. Decent meat. The 2 stars taken off were the lack of meat service for the $70 price tag.",5.0

1051,"Something about having perfectly grilled meat carved from the skewer right at your tableside just feels indulgent and sophisticated. The entire experience is not something to miss if you appreciate quality food and polished service. Sanitary measures are in place for the market table salad buffet; each customer gets a dab of hand sanitizer and pair of gloves before proceeding to the serving island. I'm not ashamed to admit I'm obsessed with the pão de queijo (cheese bread) and grilled cheese with honey side dish. We also tried their signature caipirinha, which features cachaça (liquor distilled from sugarcane juice) muddled with lime and sugar. It's a simple but tasty cocktail that also comes in a passion fruit or strawberry hibiscus version. This is a place worth trying at least once.",3.0

1053,I thought this place served meat? There was barely any meat coming out of the kitchen. I ate at the one in San Jose and it was a way different experience. The servers were constantly bringing different cuts out. I rarely had to ask for anything. This San Diego location though was a way different story. We were sitting for long periods of time without any meat coming out. We basically only had the market table bar which in my opinion is not what you go there for. This was definitely not a churrasco experience. More of a rip off.,5.0

I feel like they are short staffed. I remembered having tons of gaucho man serving the meat. And Now the whole gaucho crew are women! Nothing against women, but that is not the tradition. I feel like they are letting me down. I hope they figure a way to get better their staff. Other than that, I have their lamb chop, filet mignon, top sirloin, all the meat selection are amazing!

1072,"Following my previous review, I sent an email to the fogo feedback team and had no response for about a month. Then sent a follow up email and the manager did respond and asked me to just directly call the SD location which I did a few days later. They offered us a free comped meal since we did go to celebrate a birthday and this dinner WAS honestly very upsetting since he's not in town often. The manager we spoke to took a reservation down for us the next day and said there should be no issues and they would love to make up for it....So we show up at our reservation time and check in with the hostess. They can't find a reservation anywhere. We ask to speak to a manager and neither the one who emailed me nor the one who we spoke to on the phone were there. Waited about 15 mins for a table before we were seated and we asked multiple times to speak to any manager that was present. After about another 10 mins, a manager came by and we explained the situation, he said he would take care of it and we finally were able to start our dinner. To be honest, the service was an improvement but still not what it should be. The hostesses were still very rude to us, which as the first face to greet patrons in a restaurant, is very concerning. Our server was polite and nice which was the improvement. I would wanna note that most of the meat servers who came by were al serving the same options, while we could see different meats being carried out to the back of the restaurant ? I was kind of confused and also asked one of them if they were serving pork ribs and lamb that night because we hadn't had anyone come by with those at all. They said yes, and I thought maybe they would send someone our way but no one came and eventually we got full so it's ok. Fogo de Chao is definitely worth the experience at least once for a special occasion but the service is just such a turn off. I'm sure I will return in the future but it will be JUST FOR THE FOOD. Even if a restaurant has amazing food, you don't get to ignore and treat your patrons this way and I hope that management takes the proper steps to rectify the current attitude of ALL their employees.",4.0
1073,"Amazing food but terrible service this time... Came here on Saturday night and saw a lot of people waiting outside for a table so I would make a reservation to be on the safe side if you're celebrating an occasion and want to make sure you have a table/don't have to wait. Ambience: The interior is very nice and tables are well spaced! Outdoor dining area is also aesthetic and honestly, I wouldn't mind dining outdoors either. Service: Probably one of the worst service experiences I've ever experienced at a nice restaurant. If I'm spending $60 at dinner, I expect better service. Right from the start, the hostess was rude when I checked in, letting them know that I had a reservation and was waiting for the rest of my party to park. When our party arrived and we let the hostess know, she responded in a very rude tone for us to wait outside until our table was ready. Before we even walked out of the door, another hostess called my name to tell us our table was ready (so clearly our table was ready...but the first hostess didn't want anything to do with us??).When we went to the salad bar, most of the employees spoke in harsh tones and were very short with us for no reason. I was genuinely confused why everyone was being so rude. We tried to flag our waiter down multiple times throughout the night to get more cheese bread but were ignored about half the time. One time a server even turned around to glance at our table, made eye contact with us, and then turned around to keep walking in the opposite direction. I don't understand how this behavior is acceptable. Food: Of course, the food was amazing as always, but not amazing enough to offset the TERRIBLE service we had that night :/ Meat service was very quick since our table was in front of the kitchen! When we turned down one of the meats, the meat server asked if we were waiting on anything specific, which I appreciated. The CHEESE BREAD is immaculate ! I love the salad bar because there are so many options and helps reset your pallet when the meat gets too heavy. Overall, I do recommend fogo de chao because the experience is unlike any other. However, the poor service I experienced this visit will probably keep me from coming back for a while. This also isn't the only brazilian steakhouse in San Diego so I will probably opt to visit that one before returning to Fogo again.",5.0

I had the all you can eat brunch that includes the buffet and endless amount of protein. Definitely come hungry because there are so many delicious items to pick from. My fav were the artichoke, beans, mushrooms... mostly veggie dishes. The meats were ALL delicious, but my fav was the lamb and the filet mignon wrapped in bacon. As I am lactose intolerant I didn't have much to choose from for desserts. I ended up picking fruit as my dessert and they were so fresh. Side note regarding my lactose intolerance: I asked one of the servers what dishes from the buffet had dairy. He went above and beyond in checking which dishes were ok for me to eat. He even produced a menu ingredient list for me to keep to review as needed. The food is delish and the service top notch! Def plan on coming back and recommend this place to everyone!",3.0

The meats, and there are a lot to choose from, are all served table side. One meat is tastier than the other and everything is grilled to perfection.

I guess if we sit here long enough we might get hungry again?  Not sure if I would come again:/Update: New waitress came onto shift. She was very quick and helpful.

The first couple things that were brougt by were very good and me and my gf were happy and looking forward to whatever else they brought by us. Then after that point everything they brought us was WAY TOO SALTY! Whoever was cooking that night needs to learn to chill on the seasoning. We thought maybe it was just a couple things that were like that but the next 4 things brought by is were just as salty. I wasnt really done eating but i can't stand when stuff is over salted, it killed our evening. Like i said, good job on the service but might want to get some new cooks.

If you're a veteran, you limit yourself at the bar so as not to fill up on sides and save that limited stomach space for meat.

1101,We came in this weekend for our anniversary dinner and overall it was a great meal and the service was nearly flawless. Given some of the recent lifting of Covid restrictions we were able to dine inside and we thought everything was handled pretty well aside from some lining up with the salad bar which couldn't be helped much given how parties come and go. Our server did a great job and was very attentive and the meat servers did a great job with bringing a good variety of steaks around. All of the meat cuts were great and the filet and garlic steak were two of my personal favorites. Now that things are starting to slowly get back to normal I look forward to coming in more regularly and having more great meals.,5.0

1108,"The service was good but the picanha came four times before anything else. I watched the lamb chops and beef ribs pass us twice before the waitress finally asked us what they could bring us.The pineapple never came by and that's the one that usually the one that goes around the most at other Brazilian grills (we are Fogo regulars).The meats were cooked well and tasted great though.With the exception of the meat rotation, service was what I've come to expect from Fogo.Once we asked, they really stepped it up in bringing the food around. Salad bar was fresh. One star off because some servers skipped our table (see first paragraph). But they did fix it.",0.0

1112,"I definitely understand that Friday's and weekends get busy, especially for dinner, but it doesn't seem reasonable to have a reservation and not be seated until 45 minutes later. I know it wasn't just my party either as pretty much everyone inside was talking about the same thing.They seemed to be either short staffed or the waiters weren't very attentive. The first person who we thought was our waiter rarely checked in on us even though we saw him walking around quite a bit. Throughout the evening another gentleman apologized for not checking in on us so maybe he was our main waiter and the others were assisting? In any case, this second waiter was apologetic, helpful, and gave me a free dessert as we were there celebrating my promotion at work. As for the first gentleman I'm not sure what his role was or even where he was most of the night.Our table also seemed to be neglected quite a bit when it came to food. We had to ask multiple times for the sides to come out, the gentlemen serving meat would make their rounds to tables surrounding us but often times wouldn't come to ours. I feel like we had to flag people down most of the time.This wasn't our first time dining but this experience wasn't up to par with the others. Will still come back because I love the food, but there are definitely areas for improvement.",4.0

1116,"My review is based on customer service, food, and price.First, the front reception check-in needs work, and is one of the reason I provided 3 stars. We went there to celebrate a birthday, had reservations, and saw walk-ins seated before us because they were so frazzled and disorganized. After waiting 15-20 minutes AFTER our reservation time, I spoke up and quickly observed that the host had not even checked us in. Service...this place is hit or miss. Our server Lupe was great but, he did not appear to have much help until late in the meal. He was attentive and did his best but,  what can you do with tons of people pulling you in every direction. The carvers, again hit or miss. Half are extremely friendly and talkative, the other half appear to hate their job and the people they are serving. Toward the end of the meal we ordered dessert from a server (not Lupe) and after 45 minutes of awkward waiting, we finally flagged Lupe who got it to us 10 minutes later.For the most part, the food is good. The salad bar is kept stocked with a mixed variety. The meats were good; although, the lamb was a bit gamey for me. If you know, you know. Drinks were good-- nothing to write home about or that made me want seconds. I might come here again, I just don't know. For the price, I expected much better service. Meh.",5.0

They were just like this little frozen brazilian poppers I used to get from Whole Foods growing up - except 1000x better! I love salad, so the salad bar they had was incredible. Everything I tried was great. The servers were extremely attentive and we were taken care of extremely well.

The service staff was very attentive and the meats were better! Very fresh and hot in temperature. The place was still crowded (and it was a Tuesday!). But perhaps that means people like it. One issue remains-- the floor was still dirty with food remnants; someone needs to vacuum it regularly. And the salad bar was a bit of a mess. That also needed some tender, love & care.I also learned that there are 3 ""happy hour"" priced drinks! So I had a $7 Malbec. And It was pretty good, too.ORIGINAL:I love Fogo!

We were excited for our first time coming here, and we saved up our appetites for it.  Our reservation was at 7:15 and we were seated around that time. First red flag was how hot it was in the waiting room, but it was nothing like the dinning room, you could of cooked the picanha in there! But judging by the table service I don't think they were cooking much of anything last night.  At first a couple gauchos stopped by, tried picanha, pork ribs, and a single drums stick; for about the next 40 mins that was all that came out. And to top it off it took a whole hour for our drinks to arrive, so we started to get a little frustrated. At the end of the night we were sweaty and still hungry, we decided to cut our losses and just leave. This is not a place I would like to come to again all around the service was just poor, which is a little shocking because they highly encourage reservations here. The environment is very loud and too rowdy for the type of  date night we wanted. Fogo De Chao is not the spot.",1.0

1147,"Went for two days in a row trying different things since I usually go to other fogo's in other states.The Dry-Aged TomaHawk was not what I was expecting not only how it was cooked (I requested rare and was 3/4) but also the meat quality based in the fact I only eat stakes all the time everywhere everyday since 2010 and I think I know a little bit about it, was not great.I know tasting is a very relative concept in terms of food but based in a very simple standard I would say that at least in my visit They need to check on improvements with the salt and the cooking, when had the experience some cuts were over salted and others overcooked, I just liked rare so I was very observatory.I cannot talk about sides because I never do any.Wine cabernet was as expected, regular good.Sometimes there is no one in the entrance and that's not good in this type of restaurant.Service and Ambient was high end specially from Mile the chicken guy, you clearly can notice his service, He worries about it and I'll give him a 20 out of 10.",4.0

Servers come around to serve you a variety of cooked meat. I honestly lost track of what was what, but I'm sure we had a mix of picanha, other sirloin, filet mignon, beef ancho, lamb chop, ribs and others. The meats were cooked nicely, juicy, and some were melt in your mouth good. Some were better than others, I appreciated the beef cuts the most especially with some rareness in there. Other sides were standouts, like the cheese bread which had perfect amount of cheese, was soft and airy, the honey cheese which was melty cheese with honey, and the Brazilian street corn from the buffet table. We ordered cocktails as well like the mango habanero and the strawberry hibiscus caipirinha. Delicious but good amount of strong. Perfect pair to our meal.

When we got there, there was a line of people wrapped around the restaurant, I had assumed those were people waiting in line who didn't have a reservation so I went to the front of the hosts stand and told someone who I believe is a waitress that I had a reservation for 8. Which she told me ""You and everyone else in this line"". So we went to the back of the line and waited about 30 minutes when I got back to the hostess stand I informed her I had a reservation, she told me we would be seated as soon as there's a table available, when I asked her how long this would be she told me 2-3 hours.I understand it was Valentine's day, it was busy and to expect a little bit of a wait even with a reservation. But I made this reservation 2 months in advance expecting to be seated in a reasonable amount of time. Everyone else had a reservation for the same time.

1177,"If I could give a negative 10 I would. We went a party of five women for my daughters 20th birthday 5/8/23 around 5:30pm. We have be to the Fogo in Chicago and Naperville Illinois and have never had such a bad experience for so much money. The food was greasy, cold and could tell it was not fresh. the key lime pie was horrible it had a nasty bitter flavor and the texture was like thick sand. Now the main problem was the service. We were at our table not even able to sit down and our then server was at our table asking id we were ready to start! We weren't even in our chairs! I had to ask her if we could place a drink order first but bring water so we could look at the drink menu. After her explanation of the system (a couple women were new to the experience) she left to get water. We ordered drinks got our starters and still had our cards on red when a man came by with some pork, we asked him to come back when our cards were flipped to green, well I guess that was a mistake because once we turned them over to green the service got worse, it took forever to get anyone to stop at our table even for water refills! Then apparently we were not in need of a server because ours told us she had to be somewhere else and we would be a group effort to serve?? What is that? No clue but I had to continue to wave people down to get anything, which is insane because we were right by the servers station/computer as well as right next to the buffet table. Yet the woman who was our server kept coming by to try and push us to buy shots of tequila and sangria! The service was just horrible I have never had such an expensive negative experience in my life!",1.0

We put in the order more than a week in advance and pickup time was 4:30pm, nowhere near peak dinner time. No apologies for being late from the hostess.2. They gave our DoorDash order to the wrong driver and instead of apologizing, the girl on the phone treated us like we were at fault, even hung up when I tried to tell her that the driver was waiting at the host desk, showing her the order had not been picked up.They need to train their staff on customer service.

My group was a lost less ""domesticated"" than the typical patron (read loud and obnoxious). They did not get treated any differently than any other location I've gone to for business dinner. I truly appreciate that no one in my group was self conscious. Negatives: there are no cards anymore. It's impossible to have a conversation without interruption. They also upswell you after they take the menus. I had ppl in my group unwittingly ordering $100+ items. I covered these costs. I could have warned them, but I let them live large.

Since it was the last night they're visiting, and me and my wife's wedding anniversary we wanted to have a nice sit down dinner someone. Everything went down hill immediately when we ordered alcoholic drinks, the waitress checked our ID's, and approx 5 minutes later the manager approached us and asked to check our ID's. I assumed they were being thorough as we are in our mid-twenties and they have Texas ID's. Shortly after the waitress came back and informed us we would not be served alcohol because our ID's were ""clearly fake"". My wife offered to show our Federal ID's instead of our state, and she stated she'd call the manager back. Once he approached and I showed him my ID, I showed both my military and CALIFORNIA drivers license. He went around the table, for now a third time, checking our ID's. My brother then asked if we would be served and he stated he would ""talk with the waitress"" since he was ""asked over"" because of us. We promptly left. It was extremely disappointing because we were all prepared to spend a lot of money on a nice dinner, and it was quickly ruined. I just wanted to have a nice dinner with my family before they left. We will not be coming back to any location. I hope those who do go are treated better",5.0

I will go over my visit chronologically.I made a reservation over the phone and the host was very pleasant and when I showed up a few mins early, we were sat immediately. Upon sitting down, the waitress gave a quick explanation of how it all works and up to this point, everything was fine. Following being seated, we could not get a single host to come by to place an entree order (I personally spoke to 4 different hosts) until a manager was directed by a gaucho to come to the table. The food that did come around was very delicious and was well prepared as well as the two fish entrees. They did also bring us a cheesecake as a friendly gesture Overall, the food was good but the customer service was subpar and extremely underwhelming. I don't see myself visiting here again but if you're into a variety of steaks, chicken and lamb then it isn't a bad option.",2.0

1211,"We took a walk downtown last night and decided that we would grab a bite at a local restaurant. Being Churrascaria fans, but mew to San Diego we landed on Fogo de Chao because we had not researched any others in the area. In LA, this place is passable but not a place we go unless invited. Last night we were reminded why. We walked into the restaurant and there were 5 hostesses standing at the reception area. No one spoke until we did. They were interested I. Their phones and talking to each other. Finally I asked for a table for 2 and was rudely acknowledged and told it would be a few minutes since we didn't have a reservation which was fine. We, however, were never told how many minutes. After about 15 minutes passed we were taken to a table. The hostess never checked to see if her guests were behind her through the busy winding restaurant and we found ourselves in the kitchen. We backtracked and found her waiting at our table with no attempt to find us. We were seated and given menus with a server appearing in 15 seconds asking us what we wanted. Given we didn't have time, we asked her to return. We placed an order for ""The Full Experience"" which was Churriscaria plus Rodizio.   We also ordered tow drinks. My partner had the Caramelizes Pineapple Old Fashioned and I had the Strawberry Hibiscus Caprahina with Aged Chuchaca. Both were good and would be the high point of the evening. We proceeded to the Rodizio to find a very limited selection but had the usual fresh salad items and three hot items of black beans, rice, and butternut squash soup. The rice was cooked fine, the beans were bland with the meat being really tough.  We did not try the soup. The Farofa was clearly just out of the bag and not prepared at all. I had the chicken salad, a beet orange and fennel salad, and olives from the Rodizio. All three were very good and ended up being our entire meal. My partner made a passable salad and had some salami and cheese We, however, could nit start eating because our table was lacking silverware and we had to flag down a server (not ours) to get it. We also had fried yucca and plantains at the table. The yucca was quite good and the plantains were ok. We did ask for a second serving because, again, we were hungry and if we found something edible, we needed to take advantage of that. What we never got was Pao de Queijo. It kept being promised but it never arrived. After asking twice, our server finally said they were making more but then never followed up and it never got to the table Once the meat started coming around, we quickly discovered we were in for an adventure. Our first selection of cab was pretty bad. Gristly, burnt, and lacking seasoning, that was followed by Parmesan pork which was burnt, garlic butter beef which was gray and had the strangest texture I've ever experienced from meat, lamb chops which tasted like they had gone bad, and round of Cab Cap which we ate because it was good and we wanted to have some actual meat at the Brazilian steakhouse. The highlight? The caramelized cinnamon pineapple which I asked for another serving of because it was amazing and I was hungry. They also had a habit of taking our red/green request cards so we had to keep taking them from another table. I don't know how much they're paid attention to because we turned ours to the red side to avoid being assaulted by any more awful meat offerings but they kept coming anyway and what we saw was frightening. We finally called it and paid the $188 check. That was with tip and I must say this: we tipped 20% despite the horrible experience because there was ONE shining star and I hope she absolutely got a piece of this tip. Her name was Violet. She was attentive, she was personable, and she tried to make sure we were ok. She knew we were having a terrible experience without us even telling her and she tried her best to make it better.

1216,"We made reservations for my brother's birthday and man I was really disappointed because I genuinely enjoy Fogo.  We arrived 10min late to our reservation, but I called to let them know beforehand and they said they hold tables for 30min which is great. But once we were seated, that's when everything went wrong. My family & I were seated at the table which is the first when you enter the dining room. And it's legit the worst table to sit at! I didn't have an issue with the table at first, but when we looked around the dining room and saw everyone else closer to the kitchen get meat and not us, we realized that that particular table location was an issue. Basically our table was located in an area that by the time a gaucho comes to your table, there is little to no meat left on the spit. So for the first 30 min we were there, only my brother & I got small bits of meat and my parents nothing at all. My mom spoke up to a waitress and then out of NOWHERE the gauchos came flocking like hawks to our table all of sudden with all the diff kinds of meats. Literally like 5 guys showed up at once. Considering how much you pay per person for this restaurant, the gauchos are supposed to come around and be more attentive to people located at the tables farther from the kitchen. People don't pay $60+ a person to eat just from the market table. While the market table is good, my family didn't come to eat veggies, we came to eat meat. And since my family doesn't eat pork for religious reasons, we always request for the pork to not be sent to our table. But this was the first time my family went and we were offered pork numerous times (specifically the chicken with bacon). It just sucks because my family is used to coming here and getting awesome service but for my brother's bday, we unfortunately did not receive that at all. The only good thing is that when we made the reservation we included that we had a wheelchair and we needed space for it, and they did that. But other then that... the service sucked BIG time.",4.0

1218,"My favorite steak house in San Diego  Who doesn't love high quality meat and good service? Not anyone that I know of. Anyways I've come to Fogo several times in many occasions, specifically birthdays. And man I just love them. They're very attentive with the service here and make sure to keep checking on you and that drinks are filled. Additionally the meat here, you can order it as you like. If you're a rare person you can get that, and if you're a well done person, you can ALSO get that. It's nice that they have the ""stop and go"" cards to indicate when you want more meat or when you're content at that moment in time/done with your meal. Make sure when you are being served the meats to ask for chimichurri because that stuff will make your meat even tastier and is addicting. For your birthday, unlike most places, you get to pick the dessert yourself! And they have a wide variety of them (but no dairy free options are available just so you guys know!)The Brazilian soda, Guarana, is extremely refreshing and I cannot go here without ordering it. It is a MUST to your meal. But do keep in mind anything that is not water you will be charged for even though that this place is AYCE. The market table has plenty of different salads, gourmet cheeses, fruits (dragon fruit, star fruit, etc depending on the season), and veggies and it's a must when starting and ending your meal so you have something refreshing in between all the juicy meats. Anyways check out Fogo for a special occasion if you're a meat lover, you won't be disappointed.",4.0

The restaurant usually closes at 10 PM on Tuesday but they said because they were so overbooked they were gonna stay open later. we left around 1030 not because we where full. we only got to try 4 meats in the span of an hour and after around 1030 they start cleaning up and there was no one walking around anymore, it overall was a very unpleasant experience this time and we left hungry. probably should have said something to the manager but was just too upset at the time.",2.0
1222,"We made reservations for Father's Day. Upon arriving to the restaurant, customers are standing around in a crowd form waiting to be checked in. After finally getting an opportunity to check in, we had to wait a little over an hour to be seated. Once we were seated, there was food all over the floor near our table and the table next to us. This table had already been cleaned so it appeared the sweeping part got skipped. I brought this to the staff's attention and they did take care of it, however food (lots of rice) also sat on the floor at a clean table adjacent to us. Once we were able to go to the salad bar, there were no plates. I waited for a little bit before finding a staff member and bringing it to their attention. Once I received a plate, the salad bar was missing a lot of options. I got what I could and went back to my table. The staff walking around with the meat was pleasant. The meat and pineapples were delicious. After a while, I checked the salad bar again to see if it was replenished, but it was not. I waited and checked the salad bar for a third time, and It was replenished however it was about time for us to leave as most of my party was finished with their meals. I have previously dined at this establishment which is why I chose here for Father's Day. My previous experience was great. For such a busy day, it looked as if  they didn't have tasks specifically delegated for staff or possibly didn't have enough staff to ensure all details were taken care of to make it better dining experience.

1224,"I'm a Brazilian BBQ fanatic and have eaten at countless such restaurants across the country. Fogo de Chao is highly overrated, in my opinion. Here are my thoughts on the Fogo de Chao in San Diego:The Food:The food here is decent. As with all Brazilian BBQ restaurants, they come around with various selections of meat and slice it hot onto your plate. There's also a nice salad/food bar with various sides that you can eat alongside your meat. However, the meat isn't the highest quality and it lacks the robust flavor I have experienced at other similar Brazilian BBQ spots.The Atmosphere:This is where Fogo de Chao shines. It's a very nice ambience. Lively, clean, and elegant. It makes for an enjoyable night out for sure.The Location:The restaurant is located in the heart of downtown San Diego, which is nice. Of course, as is simply the nature of downtown, parking can be a headache. Although there are numerous paid parking lots around.The Service:The staff here is very attentive, friendly, and inviting. No complaints there.",3.0

I love to live here  but I miss Brazil so much so I decided at least to eat the best food in the world. Fogo de Chão provided the same Brazilian barbecue experience as in Brazil.

1234,"Absolutely horrible experience! Went with family tonight to celebrate an 80th birthday. We had reservations for 6:45 PM and were seated at 8 PM. After going to salad bar we waited, and waited and waited for some meat to come to the table. After only getting 2 gauchos to come to our table during a half hour span I went to ask for a manager. Violet came to see me at the front of the house and asked what the issue was. I was trying to explain the problem and before I finished she cut me off and told she was sending every cut of meat to our table. Not only did that not happen, come to find out she is not the manager. Sat back at our table and continued to see gaucho after gaucho walk past our table to the neighboring tables to offer whatever they had on their skewers. We either had to ask for them to stop or we got whatever cuts were left after the tables near us were served. Now after this continued neglect we asked for manager to come to the table. After waiting about 30 minutes for him to I again went to the hostess and asked for the business card of the manager. She informed me their wasn't any business cards for a manager. WTF! Went back to the table and finally someone named Raphael came to our table an hour after asking for a manager. He tried to resolve the issue but after all of the problems I don't think that was possible. I seriously doubt I will ever step foot in that establishment again and will recommend the same to family and friends. Especially when there is an excellent Brazilian steakhouse within walking distance of Fogo. Kudos to servers Jonathan and Matthew who were excellent and tried their best to satisfy our table, the issues were not their fault. Corporate should think about moving these two to some sort of management position.",4.0

1245,The food was amazing and is worth going however the service is horrible .  The only thing lacking was the salad bar it had NO salad or fruit like it normally does.  I understand short staffing and it being a busy Saturday night .  We waited for 1 hour at the end waiting for our bill and no one would help us.We could have easily walked without paying .  Then the manager Anthony disappears with our bill and we had to wait longer .  No apologies or any comment just handed us the bill.  I said something to the female hostess with curly hair that we waited for an hour for our bill and there was still a table that was waiting to check out .  Her response was yeah we are busy with absolute no regards and very rude.  Then she proceeded to talk poorly of us to the male host in a tie . I never write complaints but for the price you pay you expect the service to be good .So in final expect to drop a lot of money for a mediocre experience .,4.0

He remembered me from my prior visit, even remembered that I love chicken hearts. I had made requests to other meat servers and they never came back. Once again Mike came through for us bringing our requests personally. He also brought Victoria and Awesome Ava and they took care of everything else. 5 stars for you guys because you took care of my family on this special day. Fogo you get 3 stars.

1252,"My husband and I decided to have dinner here for NYE. We checked in right at our reservation time and were told that it would be about 15-20 min. At about half an hour, I asked the receptionist if she could give us an ETA. I was then told ""oh we don't have your name on the list"".  Of course, that would set anyone off. Trying not to lose it, I told her that we checked in right on time. At that point, someone else walked up to the reception station and said ""oh yeah, they're on the list and we texted them"". That was false because we had not received a text saying our table was ready. Unable to provide an explanation, they quickly sat us right after. We had been at our table for about 10 min before anyone came by. The server placed glasses of water on the table and walked away. No acknowledgement whatsoever, didn't even look at us. We finally decided to help ourselves to the salad bar and flip our card over letting the staff know we were ready for actual dinner. The area we were seated was slammed, packed to the brim. But we kept seeing the meat servers go around one side of the room and then walk out without getting to our side. I finally flagged down the server who put waters on our table and complained about the lack of service. I said we would like to order drinks and receive the sides that come with our dinner. After that, we got our sides and the staff serving the meat came around. My husband ordered a drink that never came. It was also the same meat choices one after another. There wasn't much variety like what is shown on the menu. We were so disappointed that we decided it wasn't worth asking again and we got our check and left. I understand that this was a busy night for them, but they should have anticipated this as it was NYE. The dinner here, lack of service, and lack of food quality/quantity was not worth the price we paid. Won't be going back.",5.0

I love coming here dont get me wrong, but paying almost $70 a plate by eating unlimited fried bananas and cheese bread is something not worth the money for us, sure salad bar are great but with the number of guests and how big is the place it will look like home town buffet coz food are running out, maybe they're under staff lets consider that reason as well but again with the money your paying might as well go to decent steak place where you can wait,  sit down for your order and enjoy.ust saying, true talk.",5.0

1270,"*COVID Dining Review*We had reservations for my birthday and tbh for the experience (at least during COVID restrictions) it's really not worth the high price point.With the changed format (no salad bar, meat comes out pre-sliced), we kept having to look for servers just to get specific sides we're looking for. It also seems like it was hard to get the good cuts (we liked the top sirloin and rib eye), while the bacon-wrapped meats kept circulating and coming by.We wanted to try to carmelized banana (not good) and took us a long time to flag someone down. We did appreciate the flexibility (we wanted to get the lava cake instead of the creme brulee as a complimentary birthday dessert and they made it happen). The lava cake itself though was really dry, and the vanilla ice cream on the side in comparison was much better.All in all, the service and quality of food was disappointing and definitely not worth the money.",3.0

First, if you've ever been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you know the service and how they serve the food is half the experience. Unfortunately, due to COVID, they've changed the process a little bit. For the salad bar, they have designated servers come around and ask what you would like and then they serve it for you. Honestly, this isn't as bad as it sounds and it even helped me portion control. For the meats, they simply just bring out pre-cut meats and ask you if you want some of that meat. If you don't want that one, don't worry because more will be around shortly. They no longer chop it at your table. Again, this isn't a horrible change either. This place is doing their best to keep everyone safe and sanitary and I applaud them for that. As for the actual food itself, I don't think the quality of food was affected at all. It was still extremely good even with the changes they had to make it safe for their patrons. My favorite will always and forever for the filet and ribeye. However, the lemon chicken was extremely good and literally fell apart in my mouth (in a good way). The service was very good too. I hate to say it, but I forgot our servers name. He was extremely professional and polite and made sure we were taken care of throughout the night. To my surprise, he even sent over a dessert for our anniversary! Overall, this place is great if you're looking for a pleasant meal or celebrating a special occasion. Steak your time when you eat and try not to eat much before you come so you can get your moneys worth.",5.0

1314,"I don't usually write reviews because I don't like to be THAT person, but I just had to because I'm literally hurt from dissappointment. We went out last night (2/11) on a date to this place because it had amazing reviews and a coworker recommended so I was like why not. Made a reservation for 8:45 pm. We came in a little earlier to check in and right off the bat it was so packed. But besides that we got seated pretty quick.The servers were nice but I can tell they were stressed out. The market table was basically empty. We asked for a cocktail and it took 35+ mins to bring. When we asked for a side of mashed potatoes the server told us there was no more sides at the moment and that they were rushing the kitchen to bring them out. We were told there was 16 types of meats and we only got to try 4 because it was taking so long to come around before we just decided to just go home. Food was okay. I feel bad for the staff because they were really trying but idk if it was because there was too much people that they ran out of food? Im sorry but this was a no for me and considering it was so pricy it didnt meet our expectations. :(",4.0

From the start the lobby was a mess, everyone's was asking for a table and the people at the from didn't know what to do. I had a reservation at 8:15 people got there after us and got a table first, after 30 minutes we finally got a table. It still took another 20 to finally get a server to bring us drinks. We went to get food from the salad bar which was ok. We wanted to try the churrasco experience but we didn't see any meat for another 25 minutes but it was gone before it got to our table, they clearly didn't have enough food for everyone. At this point I already had enough of waiting didn't try the meat just asked for the check which came out to $85 for the 5/10 salad bar and 2 lemonades. My wife and I don't get to go out often due to our busy schedule, it's a shame our date got ruined.",5.0

1324,"What a great place for high quality meats, along with a great salad bar. This was pre-Covid of course.One of the bright spots is the meat always came to your table, and that's all you can eat meats. Today, the salad bar is closed, and may never really return, at least the self serve variety.My first experience eating a Fogo was back in 2007 at the companies first location located in Beverly Hills. Since 2007, I have eaten at many different locations and they are all excellent. From the food, to the staff.Fogo is really the type of place that you would experience in person. Once the lockdown ends, be sure to visit here. You will be a fan for life.",5.0
1325,"Ordered delivery through DoorDash. My husband and I used to come here all the time pre-pandemic. I was extremely excited to see that they do their churrascaria plates to go / for delivery.   I ordered the one meat plate and decided on my favorite, Cordeiro lamb picanha. The meal comes with 2 sides of choice and 2 cheese breads. Unfortunately, I only got 1 cheese bread and it was smashed in my to go box. I chose asparagus and feojoada with rice. There was not of grain of rice in sight and the beans were pure salt. The asparagus was bland. The worst part was the lamb. I figured with delivery, it would not arrive hot, so I opted for a rare- medium rare temperature to reheat. The lamb smelled terrible and had a strange greyish-green hue to parts of it. It was cold but fully cooked with barely any pink in the middle?! It tasted so gamey I couldn't even eat it. I've never had such disgusting lamb in my life. I ended up throwing the entire meal away. I should have just flushed my $30 down the toilet. Will absolutely not eat here ever again.",1.0

1330,Best steak house for your money! Service is just as great. The salad bar is to die for! Try the bottom sirloin steak - the best!!,4.0
1331,"I love this place. My go to restaurant when I'm craving meat. Why not a steakhouse? It's a different experience. With Brazilian steakhouses, you have servers walking around of different meat skewers. On your table, you have a little round placard. When you want the servers to come by, leave the green placard up. When you have enough meat and want to slow down a little bit, you can flip the placard to red. Every Brazilian steakhouse will have a great salad bar. Why not? If you can fill up on rice, vegetables, and cheese, then you don't have to eat as much meat?There are plenty of Brazilian steakhouses, but there's only One Fogo de Chao. Here, the cost is about $60 for an adult and half the price for kids between 6 to 12 years old. You should save your stomach before you go here in order to get your money's worth. You need a strategy, especially to counter the restaurant's plan to minimize your intake of higher quality meats. My strategy may be different than yours, so develop your own, but make sure you execute it. When you get there, they are going to ask for drinks while you settle down. They will make you wait a bit so that you will have to go to the salad bar. You have no choice. Get the green, leafy, high fiber veggies so that you won't get constipated after nesting a huge amount of meats. Don't be tempted to get soup, ham, or cheese. Eat these while you wait, but be careful with their next defense, cheese filled rolls. These are unbelievably tempting. The smell of the rolls is so inviting but stay strong to your plan and ask for meat. We waited and waited and their first server was offering bacon-wrapped chicken and beef, and sausages. By this time, we were so hungry that the natural survival instinct is to get a few chicken and beef. Big mistake! Don't fall for that trap of filling up with bad quality meat. Remember, your stomach can only fill up a certain amount of meat , so choose them wisely. Don't let your stomach dictate your decision.Their next line of defense is pork ribs. While ribs are good, it's still cheaper to eat pork than beef. Work around this barrier and order the 1) house special upper sirloin, 2) ribeye, 3) filet mignon, and  4)lower sirloin. You have to ask for the filet mignon or else they won't bring it out. The top sirloin and ribeye were both amazing!!! If you're able to holdout to the top sirloin, you're right be right on track to maximize your intake. Since they don't come back frequently, try to order two pieces at a time.at dome point, you will be sick and tired of eating meat. When you reach this point, eat the cheese rolls. Somehow, the bread reset your taste buds and you can now show any few more meat into your mouth. After you're completely stuffed, ask for the fried bananas that came out of the bread. This is complementary whereas you will have to pay for the desserts. It's up to you! For #Thinsulin fans, there's plenty of green light choices. I highly recommend this restaurant. Just come prepared and you won't regret it.",0.0

1334,Outside seating only . Reservation required for limited seating . Dinner at 7 pm for us . $60 per person includes meats from filet mignon to cordeiro (lamb) . saw one of the host sanitizing every inch of the tables and chairs after the parties were leaving so it made me feel comfortable . Upon arrival you get a host to seat you then someone bringing your drinks and starter plates and a server . In a normal setting there would be different people walking around with meats asking if you would like some on your plate but the host is telling you what is available and bringing it out themselves to the table to avoid more contact . They all do wear masks . Meat was all delicious except for the ribs which I found really dry . Polenta with bananas as our last dish so sweet and yummy .,5.0

1337,"Terrible Mother's Day out. Weren't seated until 45 minutes after our reservation time. Woman in front calling out names had a nasty attitude. I've met friendlier employees at Arby's. Bathrooms were disgusting. Didn't get utensils for 20 minutes. Food came around for about 20 minutes then we were suddenly cut off from getting more. We asked several people including our server to bring more food around but no luck. We eventually got frustrated and left, had to stop at McDonald's on the way home because our kids were still hungry. They wanted chicken and Fogo De Chao was unable to fulfill a request that the McDonald's drive through had no issue with. We've been here several times and this was the last time. I would have asked for a manager but I figured that would result in us spending another 3 hours waiting to talk to someone. $200+ dollars on absolute garbage service and we weren't able to try everything included with the ""experience.""

1340,"Fogo de Chao is going down hill.  It used to be the creme de la creme of Brazilian churrasco.  I've been to Fogo de Chao all over the US and also in Brazil.  The US locations are losing quality control.  We went to this one in the Gas Lamp District, and every single meat they brought us was dry and burnt.  Mind you I wanted rare cuts.  Even when somewhat rare in the middle, the meat was chewy and it was burnt to a crisp on the outside.  There is only one reason for this.  They go around with the meats and then they put them on the BBQ (churrascera) over and over and over. I told them the meats were dry and burnt and they just said ""we're sorry to hear that"", and then presented me with the bill.   Big waste of money.   Texas Do Brazil in Carlsbad is way better.",1.0

One star off because you have to ask for the most select meats to be brought by rather than having them plentifully offered. Also, there was no seafood on the salad buffet, which is often a staple at other places of this caliber and price. If you are looking to try churrascaria in San Diego, this is your place.",4.0
1365,"I love Brazilian BBQ. I was happy to find out they were open for dine in. We were able to make a reservation online and were seated within 15 minutes of arrival. I wouldn't want to sit outside because so many people can walk by and distract you from the experience. SERVICE: Everyone was very polite and professional. There were times where a few items were forgotten like rice, certain meat requests, and other sides, but once we alerted one of the staff, they were quick to bring it out. They were consistent on coming around and offering us a new plate as well. DRINKS: We got a few delicious drinks off their cocktail menu. The strawberry hibiscus was beautifully crafted with strawberries and lime to perfectly complement the tequila. The mango habanero had the perfect kick to it. It sounded weird at first but then we were hooked! Their old fashioned was a little inconsistent each (3x) time we got it. We didn't know there was a bar cart rolling around too, or we would have ordered from him, too! He was really funny/cool. FOOD: We got a round of appetizers in the beginning such as caesar salad, apple salad, caprese salad, mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, polenta, and more! I miss being able to go to the buffet bar, but because of covid, they bring the sides to your table. We wish there were more sides doing their rounds during our meal, as we kept getting offered the same mashed potatoes and polentas the entire time until we asked for asparagus and other greens. By then I was already too full to eat more! Can't forget about the main event - the meats! They made their rounds and did not disappoint! Their picanha, filet mignon, and ribeye cuts were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Their lamb was really tender and not too gamey. There was never a shortage of meat on my plate so I was filled up pretty well. Overall, it was a good experience. The only thing I would touch upon is to bring around different kinds of sides and explain the menu at the beginning even if some of the party has been there because we had to play search and find for prices, what we get, etc.",4.0

1369,"Had a 715 reservation and was seated at 815 an hour later. The couple next to us had a seven o'clock reservation and waited an hour plus. Why even take reservations at that point. The buffet was mediocre, but held us over until the meat. The meat was good, but we waited and I'm not exaggerating, an hour for one margarita. This is supposed to be an upscale establishment and I would not rank our experience upscale to that point. To top things off we did not get tongs throughout our entire meal even though about four different people had assured us we would be brought tongs. We ended up having to use our own forks to take meat from the same portion as the rest of the restaurant. Not very sanitary if you ask me. Overall not a great experience. Once we had eaten we could not wait to get the check and go some where else for drinks and dessert.",2.0

The service is always great, but tonight we celebrated a birthday and it was even more spectacular than the usual dining experience due to the great customer experience. The entire restaurant staff was amazing, but two associates truly stood out which were Royal our server and Mike one of the gentleman who bring around different cuts. They were extremely attentive, polite, funny, and just overall top tier service. I really enjoyed my food this night not because the cuts had extra seasoning, but because of the help I got during my dining experience. There was a moment where I sat and needed something because whenever anything came to mind they were already working on it. The restaurant was pretty full, but the staff had me feeling like our party of 8 were the only ones there. I look forward to coming back next weekend for another parties event and hope I get to show up on the day these two employees work. It was a great birthday and dinner. Thank you Fogo for the experience.",5.0

1380,"I love churrascarias and visited different ones all across the world. So i had high expectations of this place. After debating whether to come here or to Rio de Gaio we came to Fogo de Chao (following the yelp reviews that said that the meet here is better). However we were very disappointed. let me start with the good things: We came at 4 (making reservation at 3) and there was no long waiting line. The waitresses were nice and accommodating coming by changing our plats, asking if we need anything else. Salad bar - was ok. The salads were fresh and delicious. Variety was not huge but it was good.Fried banana was delicious. That's pretty much it in terms of good things. We payed a full dinner price yet for some reason, despite asking several times for the meet to be brought to us, we didn't get all the meet varieties and the ones we did get, we needed to ask the waiter a few times for them and had to wait a long time for them. The speed with which the meats came was very (very very) slow. To the point that after asking several times to bring meet, just gave up and went away. We eventually only tried 6 types of meat (4 beef types, chicken leg and a lamb chop). So technically we payed 120 $ (before tip) for a few pieces of meat. This is not what they promise, they promise a pretty big variety of meet and all you can eat experience. Which we just didn't get. Now about the quality of meet: It was also disappointing. The meets that came seemed to have two levels of readiness only (extra well done or rare). I like my meat medium and they couldn't accommodate it. I am not a fan of really raw meet, so the meat person always suggested to cut the outer part, which was overly made. The slice that would be one level in was already raw (never had this problem in other places.) The beef: Picanha was very salty (maybe becouse i was getting only the outer pieces?...).Garlic stake (or something like this) was overly done and the taste was just ok (some weird aftertaste that i couldn't understand or like). filet mignon  - well done (which basically killed the meet for the second time).Ribeye  -  was ok. The lamb chop looked good - but when i tried it, i couldn't eat it, it was soaked in lemon to the point you couldn't taste the meet. Not sure why soak lamb that has such a delicate taste in so much lemon?The chicken legs were ok, they were  - not my favorite but at least we got them... So as you can see, this experience was not good to say the least. Oh, I forgot to mention. The outdoors sitting that I initially wanted to use is just tables on half of the pedestrian area of the street  (where everyone walks , including homeless people) under a tent. No fence to separate you from the pedestrians. Plain tables, with no heating or anything. Looked bad. We decided to sit inside. I think this place can make a bit more effort and get better.",5.0

1384,"Wasn't the best experience.Was called to sit down, walked to out table to realize another waitress sat other people down. Moved back out to the front waited another 15 mins after waiting an hour. Finally, sat down..... overpacked and overbooked. People were sitting shoulder to shoulder and you barely could move in the restaurant. Was served bottle sodas so no free refills unless you order tea. Which you would think you get free refills paying over $60 for your dinner. The sirloins and the pork ribs came around a lot. But, we had to ask multiple times for petite filet, bacon wrapped chicken/steak and beef ribs. Sadly, those were the last to come out. No dessert options in their buffet. But, you could order dessert. Bill was $185 with tip. Note: don't make a reservation on a holiday because you will still have to wait 45 mins plus. Plus, the floor was really dirty, with all the people in the restaurant there was food and trash on their carpet and their bar floor was stinky. Not the best experience I've had.",0.0

I'm writing this review just to let you know how he goes above and beyond to make our stay worth coming back without reiterating we do love the food and the atmosphere it's just the exceptional long wait we have each time before it gets served keep up the good work Mike once again and thank you for your service.,3.0
1388,"Four words... 5 stars...Mike ""the chicken guy"" I felt utterly compelled to give this review. And I don't give reviews. Our party was here on Christmas. To say it was chaotic is an understatement. What started off as a bad experience due to poor management, waiting 2 hours past our reservation to be seated was really annoying. Once we were seated the only person who came by to check on us was Mike. He noticed that we had been there for a little while, still had nothing to drink,. no side dishes or anything. He explained to us the procedure of how it worked there, and from that point on Mike went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and we had an awesome experience because of you Mike.

1390,"I've been to this location twice before and have had a decent time, but last night was the worst experience yet. We booked a reservation on Opentable and they were ready for us right on time. The place was packed, so I was glad to see that we were in a smaller room with a few other tables. We were away from the noise and crowds of the main dining room, but definitely received less meat throughout the night. I am vegetarian (brought my boyfriend here for his birthday because he is definitely not), and even I could tell that tons of the meat was overdone and too chewy. My boyfriend is not picky at all, but he had a bunch of inedible chunks left over on his plate. The salad bar is usually decent here which is why I don't mind paying so much, but last night it was repeatedly under-stocked and super crowded. Tons of cross-contamination between dirty serving spoons and tongs, and many of the dishes were missing labels so I wasn't sure what was actually vegetarian. Also, everything from the salad bar tasted quite bland with very little seasoning on anything I tried. I was honestly a little grossed out and only went back once, not something I would've wanted to pay $35 for. Lastly, the waiter did offer us a free dessert for my boyfriend's birthday, but ended up bringing out the wrong one. We ate it anyways and it was fine.I know times are tough for restaurants right now, but this place was PACKED. There's no reason that a restaurant charging this much should have such mediocre food. The service was okay, we got things when we asked, but everyone working seemed to be flustered and overwhelmed. I'm sure this place hasn't been untouched by staffing shortages, supply chain issues etc., but they're clearly still raking in enough cash to mitigate some of these issues. Not sure if I would come back to this location again.",5.0

While visiting San Diego, I decided to take my family to this place. Made reservations and that's pretty much the good stuff. We were expecting a bit more from this place. We had to ask multiple servers when are we going to get served. And when we finally got meat, they all tasted the same and a tad bit salty. But the asking to be served more meat continued, it just ruined our appetite. I mean, if we are going to pay big bucks for dinner, I expect to be served the food we are paying for. I was embarrassed for suggesting this place to my visitors and I myself can cross this out my list to try and move it to the not coming back list.

This is unacceptable and not a good business practice. Once we were finally seated service was lacking and spotty that is until Mike the chicken guy came to our section. He was serving pork products, we do not eat pork, as we are Jewish. We mentioned This to Mike and he brought us a multitude of different cuts of beef. He not only took care of our family but took care of everyone in our section. He is by far our favorite server. He turned our night around.

Our drinks didn't come for 20 minutes, the fries for my nephews didn't come until almost the end of dinner and we could never find our server.

1438,"One of the worst experiences ever. Came here on a Sat night with a reservation for my husband and I on our anniversary. As soon as we arrived, they asked us to wait in the bar for about 15 minutes past our reservation time. We were then seated in the back and greeted by a few servers. It was our very first time experiencing a Brazilian steakhouse and so they politely gave us directions as to how everything works. We were so excited given our friends and family would tell us that a Brazilian steakhouse is a must. Time passes and I notice that many of the waiters serving slices of meat passed our table MULTIPLE times. We sat at our table for about an hour with our cards turned green and we were only offered 3 slices of meats (just lamb to be exact) and grilled pineapple as if there weren't any meat available. We then politely tell our waitress- who was only doing her job and was trying to apologize. Still, nobody comes. We ask to speak for the supervisor, which then Violet comes. We tell her about our terrible experience and she apologized and STILL tried to put plates down (after everything has been cleaned away) to try and make it up. I told her that it's already been a little over an hour and we had plans to see a broadway show (that we ended up being late to). She says ""give me 2 seconds"" and doesn't come back for about 10 mins offers us a gift card so that we can come back on our NEXT anniversary. It wasn't even something they could've helped us the night of with. We had to wait another year to try again in hopes of getting good service?? Why would I pay the price of something I did not receive?? The gift card didn't even comp an entire meal for 2 ppl as we would still have to pay the difference. Also, not being so local and after having a bad experience.. no thanks.. I would rather take my money elsewhere that doesn't skip our table and serves us with quality service and food. Never coming back.",4.0

1440,"I was so excited to eat here for the first time. I made a reservation and still had to wait about 30 mins for my table but that did't bother me at the time. However, I noticed that it was pretty dirty once you get into the actual dining room. Also, the service was TERRIBLE. A server took our drink orders and came back 25 mins later. He also told us he would be back with our sides of mashed potatoes and other things but he NEVER came back. He didn't come back to check on us either until we were ready to pay the bill. All except one person walking with the meats ignored my table (which is weird because I sat right in front of the buffet bar). One person who was walking around with meats made eye contact with me, I smiled and asked if I can have some, and he walked away from me with the meat?????? I was genuinely confused. There was a long piece of hair in the cauliflower at the buffet bar as well. If I could give 0 stars?, I would. I Spent money on the churrasco experience and only ate 3 pieces of meat and didn't even get all of the sides. NEVER coming back here again.",4.0

1445,"While you typically go to a Brazilian Steakhouse for the endless meat brought to your table so you don't have to exert even the smallest amount of energy, there was something else served that changed my very outlook on life. Fried cheese with a spicy honey. The server that brought it out did not lie when she said ""this is the best thing here."" All 5 of us were transformed with the first bite where the tartness of the cheese paired beautifully with the sweetness of the honey. Also note worthy were:-the grilled pineapple with cinnamon-the picanha -the bacon wrapped steak-the Brazilian limeadeAll of these 5 items are what pushed me to leave a 5 star review. Most of the other items were a bit disappointing especially considering the $60 a person price point. It did take us quite a while to start getting served but they were a bit packed and the servers were friendly nonetheless. The atmosphere and location are top notch and if you are down in San Diego it is worth a stop.",5.0
1446,"Trying to figure out why people love this place so much. Had to ask for people to bring us meat so we could even try it, and after trying it i was still disappointed. I appreciate a good cut of meat from a small diner or a high end place I do not care as long as it's good, but the meat was so dry and bland here. Super packed and extremely loud. The little buffet is such a cramped space and was extremely difficult to move around in. I did not like one thing about my experience here. Maybe the cheese bread but that was it. I filled up on said bread because everything else was pretty awful. Way to much money spent here on a party of 6. I will never be back.",1.0

The cheese sections so it lost a star here when compared to the LA branch.  Overall the service was good as they can be by at least 3-4 times asking if we needed any special plates, as they should have since we paid full price.  A few items were scrumptious for the typical all you can eat Brazilian BBQ at this price.  I think that they should really come with the same level of excellence in any branch.  Who knows we'll see.  This is the only 2nd location we've tried.

1460,"You want to know what's similar to heaven? *flips card to green* *servers asking if I want meat back to back* That's what. My best friend and I ate here for our first time for a joint birthday celebration and enjoyed the churrasco dinner experience. We didn't indulge in the salad/hors d'oeuvre bar because the main focus at a Brazilian steakhouse is obviously the meat. My favorite sides were the garlic mashed potatoes that they bring to your table, as well as the cheesy bread. They are not selfish when it comes to giving you a healthy portion of meat. Sometimes the pieces were overwhelming and too thick/fatty for me, so I had to start asking for smaller pieces. I forgot what my favorite protein was, but my least favorite was the lamb. I like lamb, but it was very pungent and strong in smell and not as flavorful as I'm used to. Along with our mixed drinks that we ordered, the bill was close to $150 and for the amount that we ate, it was worth it. The service was great too, aside from taking a while on some of the sides.I probably wouldn't come back for a while, and this place was delicious, but I wasn't too crazy about it. I thought I'd have a more mouthwatering experience, but it was alright. I still give it 4 stars though because of atmosphere and most of the meats that I had.",4.0

Once we were seated our server came around explained how it worked. The Salad bar was large and had plenty of selections to choose from. When we were ready for meats to arrive we would flip a coaster over to green. All sorts of servers come around with various types of meat. You can request which ones you want to try. And the amount you want is all you can eat. Everything was so delicious. Once you were all done you flip the coaster back over to red to let the servers know your done.

1473,"The ONLY reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of our server KU'ULEI. She alone deserved 5 actually for being attentive to our frustrations. If it weren't for her honestly I would've only given 2 if that. We came here for my daughter's bday. We were a party of 11 and came on a fairly busy night. We were excited because we usually go to Rei De Gado but we liked the way the ambiance looked here so decided to try something new. First of all the ladies in the front looked irritated that we were there. We had to wait for more than half of our party to be there so when there was and I approached her she looked even more irritated. That was my first tick of the night. So now comes the dinner. We were patient.....a few of us got meat and when I mean a few maybe like 5 out of the 11 of us while we watched the guys with the meat pass the rest of us by. I get it, we're a big party, and they don't want to run out of meat on us, I'm wondering if that was the reason. But after watching so many cuts of meat pass us by I was about to say something when Ku'ulei came up and asked us what meats we wanted and how we wanted it cooked. Then and ONLY then did we have service and meat FINALLY coming to us. Some of the cuts were good, some I wish I had passed on. We even caught attitude from 1 of the Gauchos. From now on we will be sticking with Rei de Gado. Even with a big party they kept the meat coming and the service has always been amazing. If their staff had the same sense of customer service as Ku'ulei and Rei De Gado, we would've made this place our Go To, but unfortunately we're passing on this place.",5.0

1481,"Went here recently for lunch and it wasnt the best experience. It first began with my grandmother ordering a lemonade and the waiter corrected her multiple times saying that they only had limeade. After she pointed out that lemonade was on the menu he checked the menu and realize that as she said lemonade was there. we also noticed that multiple servers were skipping our table when bringing different types of meat to other tables nearby. When my grandmother received her chicken entrée it was very dry and she wanted to speak with someone about her experience. They said that they would not take it back because it would go in the trash and the waitress yelled across the table to someone else saying ""she has a complaint!"". Lastly one waiter told us that they do not do togo boxes however another waiter overheard us talking about that and said literally ""who told you that?!"" And brought us a box. Generally i had good feeling about this place previously because i've been before. But today's service rubbed me the wrong way and I left very underwhelmed. (Too bad the service wasnt good because management made an effort to continue checking on us, but it was often followed by rude and dismissive service, not all , but those that served us).",2.0

1488,"As a food critic, I've heard of this place being a great place to experience. I brought a colleague with me to get their intake on this visit as well. We've reviewed places all over including Japan. In the beginning we got seated fairly quick which was great. Once we were taken to our table a gentleman with a lot of hair came to us and introduced himself as our waiter and that he would be taking care of us and then asked us if this was our first time dining in with them, we stated yes this is our first time. He gave us a menu and walked away. Puzzled on what we need to do next since we got no explanation on their specific process. We patiently waited for him to return. Once he returned we asked how this works he then explained the salad bar and the meats that will be coming out constantly, said he will be back for our drink order then walked away. As we waited, about 25-30 mins for him to come back and take our drink order and figure out what we need to do next we decided to just head to the salad bar. Once we got back we continued to wait for him to return back. A table next to us got seated after us and had already had their drinks and side dishes. Puzzled and confused we did not understand why our server never returned. Fortunately, the server at the next table noticed we had just been sitting there and she came up to us and asked if we have been helped at all. We stated and pointed out the guy who said he was going to take care of us. She kindly asked us what we would like to drink. She kept checking in on us and brought us out the sides we never got. After being neglected for a while SYLVIA is the one who catered to us and made our experience turn around. She made us laugh and brought us out anything we requested. If it was not for Sylvia I think we would of left more upset than we did tonight. Her service was outstanding and because of people like her is the reason that will bring customers back and keep them satisfied. The food... to be honest lacked flavor. A lot of the meats that came out was dry. The steak that came out was extremely red and was not cooked. The only meat that came out to our table was sirloin, that came to us about 7 times extremely red and bloody . Pork sausage that came to us about 5 times most times looked burnt and black. Parmesan chicken that came out once was not too bad. More tender with a strong Parmesan flavor. We had pork ribs come out once and let me tell you my rib was just bone! It had no meat and look so dry. We had a chicken leg come out that was dry and tough to eat. It had no flavor whatsoever. I was extremely disappointed in the flavor of everything that came out (out of what we got). We had to request bacon wrapped steak and chicken to come out. They were a little better but also tasted a bit sweet from the bacon. Definitely not enough seasoning to make it pop. The one thing I honestly enjoyed was the cinnamon pineapple. You cant really mess that up but that had the most flavor out of this whole experience. The mash potatoes were very watery and running but actually had a great flavor. The atmosphere of the restaurant was crowded. The tables are way too close to each other. You can barely walk around to get anywhere. The workers do not wait for any customers to go first. They will cut you off and make you wait to pass. When it is busy I understand but customer service should be priority. The bathrooms were somewhat clean but you can tell it was not constantly maintained throughout this experience. Would I recommend this restaurant to others, I would not and would recommend another Brazilian restaurant in Southern California for them to try. Honestly, Texas De Brazil we had an outstanding experience and food was incredibly tasty. Lots of flavor and tremendous customer service. Again, I would like to shoutout Sylvia for actually caring and taking care of us through this experience. I gave three stars only because Sylvia, If it was not for her I would have rated no stars. She deserves the 5 stars!",4.0

The staff seating people kept telling people walking in the door that the seating will be a ""few mins"". If someone asked how long, they would say ""20 mins"". By being honest they would have lost business so they kept people hanging for over an hour even with reservations!! The restaurant was packed. Tables so close to each other and crammed. Moving about the restaurant is tough.  Asked waiter for the ""Malagetta Pepper Sauce"" and 30 mins later, he came back with something that was not what I asked for. When I said this is not what I am looking for, he went to look in the kitchen again and said he couldn't find it. No reputable Brazilian place is out of the ""Malagetta Pepper"". Replenishment of sides took 20 mins. Also, two wait staff started screaming at each other right behind us. No manager was in sight to stop the argument in a tightly packed restaurant.

1500,"Was there a while back and sat in the bar for happy hour.  A very pleasant experience.  The bartender/server, Angel, was exactly that, taking time to explain the menu and the various Brazilian traditions as well as serving us customizations to the featured (and delicious) house cocktails.Everything we tried, from the Empanadas to the skewers to the full market table experience was terrific.  Only minor complaint was that the signage on the plethora of dishes along the market table was poorly arranged or missing.  While some items are obvious, others are, ""what is that?"".  Safety tip:  those tiny little red peppers will burn your face off.  Somewhere between a habanero and a Scottish bonnet.  There was no sign, only regret.Also (and no fault of Fogo de Chão), the gaslamp is a filthy sh**hole.  It looks like Los Angeles or San Francisco.  Parking is challenging and expensive and you wonder whether your car will be there when you go to leave.",5.0

1503,An upscale steak house with a variety of cuts of meat along with an open salad bar. You order the different cuts of meat by utilizing an indicator of one side red to stop the meats to be served and green to serve the cuts of meats.  It was good food but needs work on uniformity of professionalism based on the cost of eating at this site.,4.0
1504,Had a reservation at 730. They called and moved it to 830. No big deal cause we had a party of 12. Got there and they now said 9. Then was told they gave our table away. We were early so no reason to give the table away. Manager said he was sorry and would pick up our drinks and appetizers from the bar. Problem was we couldn't get service at the bar.  Sat for over an hour with no drink or food. Avoid this place like the plague.  Bad service...bad management and honestly they could care less about the customer. It is all about volume with this place. Much better places in Gas lamp to eat then this dump.  Lastly someone in our party ordered the fish. They fail to bring it out. When we told them about they brought it out raw and said that the kitchen was running late. Would have believed it but it was already 1030 and they were officially closed. Would not recommend and again. Go somewhere else when in Gaslamp.,1.0

1506,"I have visited this restaurant a few times and always had a positive experience but this particular night wasn't not great. We were seated around 7:20pm and waited another 10 mins or so to be helped. After our dinner was over, we had a total of 5 slices of meat, 1 mashed potato, and 2 cheese bread. We filled ourselves up on appetizers with the lack of meat being provided. It was extremely disappointing because we're not paying 65$ a person just to get 5 SLICES of meat and appetizers the whole time. On top of that, it was our anniversary dinner and we wanted it to be a special night but instead we left with a $190 check and nearly empty stomachs. Don't know if we will return again. Rather spend our money on a steak house that we know will get us full with our moneys worth. No to mention, servers who will actually acknowledge our presence and be organized enough to know which customers have been there vs which customers have just gotten there.",4.0

1508,"I visited this location on December 4, 2021 and had the absolute worst experience of my life. I made reservations for a party of 5 two weeks in advance for 7:30pm due to it being my fiancé's birthday- I got to the location early and checked in. The hostess said we will be seated in a moment and i continued to sit in the bar area with my full party until 8:05pm, not a single person informed me that they were running behind or that they were going to need additional time to seat my party which would have been fine. After being seated a waitress greeted us named Elsa and brought out waters for the table- we turned all of our cards green and waited. My table waited over 20 minutes before we had to ask wait staff from a different section on why we weren't being served any meat, he informed us that another table had just said the same thing and we are now on a ""priority list"". That issue was cleared up but the meat being served was no cooked well- it was very dry and lots of well done pieces being served of higher quality meats which was unexpected. Eventually we had a request for a specific meat and asked the closest waitress nearby who then said ""sure"" with the blankest face and rolled her eyes at my entire table. My entire party of five was taken aback with that response because the request was extremely nice and it was very simple- just chicken. I then asked our original waitress Elsa what he name was because that was very unprofessional and rude and my experience was already deteriorating. She informed me that her name was Annamarie and I continued on with the dinner. One guest at my table informed me that every time Annamarie walked around the dining area she stared at me and rolled her eyes, at first i didn't believe it but every time I looked up she was staring at me giving the rudest look! I have never experienced wait staff treat me this way in my entire life, it was like I was being targeted. Annamarie walked around the entire dining floor asking every table if they were doing okay and excluded ours intentionally. On top of this every one at my table had mixed drinks that through this dinner kept getting more watered down and longer to retrieve from the bar. I eventually asked for a manager from a waiter named Bob- who was honestly heaven sent and the nicest person I encountered all night. He sent over the customer service manager named Veronika who informed me that she had no excuses for the service being this way and she would later ""speak to Annamarie in her office tonight"" which honestly made me feel my concerns were unheard and I was not taken seriously with the issue at hand. After that conversation Veronika left and said she would take care of our tab and she would be right back. We wait for a bit and then Annamarie of all people walks up to our table and asks if we need the bill. I inform her that Veronika is helping us and she goes on to state ""I don't even know who that is"". Literally how embarrassing is this experience now! I have never been treated this way and especially at a ""high end"" restaurant. Veronika came back with the tab taken care of and a gift card for the table. Honestly would never return to this location, I have visited the Atlanta location with a much much better experience. With all of this being said it was my fiancé's birthday and it was never acknowledged and I wish I would have book reservations at STK steakhouse down the street.",4.0

1514,"This was one of the best birthday dinners ever (thanks, bestie)!  I kept hearing about how awesome the one in Los Angeles is, and finally got to try this one. WOW. Didn't even realise it was an all you can inhale Brazilian experience! And inhale we did. We had never been before, so they explained to us how it worked. You go and fill up your plates with luxurious salads, sides, breads, bacon, pickles, veggies, then come back to the table where you have a green (yes, gimme) card that you can flip over to a no (stop, I'm chewing) card. When it's green, the servers with meat platters will come to you and slice off whatever is in circulation: chicken, lamb, steak. You get to choose how you want your meat done and they'll cut from the appropriate section. Flip your card to red and they won't disturb your it. It's just... wow. It was all so delicious. They also bring you Brazilian garlic bread and cheese bread.It was about $120 for two of us and they have us a coupon for a free lunch visit to use within 3 months. Totally going back ... maybe in LA or San Jose to mix things up. We parked several blocks up the street to get exercise on purpose... it was not cheap. Highly recommend this place.",5.0

For those that have never been here before it is a really straight forward experience and they will explain it. This restaurant isn't cheep and making reservations is highly suggested. However, I came in on a Friday for lunch with my parents and we were able to be seated right away. Before I start talking about the meat...this is all of the good. We did the full experience with the salad bar. The wine list isn't very impressive reminds me of a list you'd see on a golf course bar. The scotch list was a touch more impressive but the pour was what really impressed me. Received a double of Macallan 12 for a very reasonable price. The tres leche cake we ordered was AMAZING. Ok. Now for the meat. It was yummy. It wasn't extra ordinary but it was worth it. The overall experience was ok. A major pet peeve was seeing them remove the white table cloth off a nearby table and setting it back up again.  The price was decent for the atmosphere. It was around $50 per person at lunch and that was with alcohol and dessert. For sure give this place a try during lunch if you're hesitant because it is cheaper but the quality is still the same. Never felt like I was looking for a server and they really anticipated what we needed even though the restaurant was full.",4.0
1522,"During the holiday time, we wanted to try something nice like a fancy restaurant that we couldn't visit during the pandemic time. We saw Fogo de Chao is available for delivery so we decided to give it a try since we wanted to support restaurants that are most impacted by limited indoor dinning. I wasn't sure what to expect since they are a buffet style high end Brazilian steak restaurant which is not suitable for takeouts. On the DoorDash menu, they now provide marinated meat that is ordered by pound for you to cook at home. Otherwise, you can order a meal set that comes in one or two pieces of meat and 2 sides. The price is very reasonable, $20 for one meat and $24 for two. We both decided to get 2 meat meal set since we wanted to sample different meats. The delivery came very quickly and it's well packaged. Each combination platter is in a box and meats are wrapped in foil to keep the meat warm. When we opened the meats, it's still warm and ready to eat. I was impressed by how good they preserved the meat in its delicious state even for Togo orders. For the 4 different types of meat, we loved the lamb, steak wrapped with bacon, and the bottom sirloin. However the top sirloin was quite dry despite we asked for medium rare. With the delivery and meat wrapped in foil, the meat could be cooked more than medium rare. We really enjoyed their well seasoned well flavored and wood fired steak. Their generous portion of asparagus was also very delicious. We had a wonderful dinner even at home because the food was absolutely delicious. It's smart of them to offer smaller combination plates and continue to allow customers to enjoy their wonderful steaks.",0.0
1523,"Are you a meat lover? Are you a steak enthusiast? Are you ready to eat a month worth of meat in one meal? If your answers are YES to above questions, then keep reading because this place is specially designed for you! Fogo de Chao Brazilian Steakhouse is a franchise that focuses on providing high quality steak  in traditional Brazilian style and creating a unique dinning experience. It is high-end all you can eat restaurant. Once you sit down, you can start eating until your stomach is past its limitation. They offer the top of line salad bar with freshest produces. Some of my personal favorites are their seasoned shiitake mushrooms, white bamboo shoots, jumbo asparagus, and many more. Wide variety of salad selection, fresh produce, and cheese can fill you up without other items. I understand you want to eat as much meat as possible when you are at Fogo de Chao because you are paying big bucks for it. However, I recommend to take a moment and try some of their salad bar because it will help you balance out the meat and have a more balanced diet. Other than the salad bar, the main attraction of this restaurant is served right to your table. All their steak/meat is prepared in traditional Brazilian style on a skewer over fire. Therefore, all types of meat is brought to you by their skilled server right to your table. You have the option to pick and choose what kind of meat you like. Some of my personal favorites are FILET MIGNON, RIB EYE, BOTTOM SIRLOIN, AND PICANHA (PRIME TOP SIRLOIN). Their beef is definitely top quality. However, due to the way it's prepared, it may be overcooked if the server is not paying attention to your request. Personally, I like my steak medium rare if it's high quality steak. I sometime received medium well which was not the most ideal for me. However, each serving is very small so you can easily wait for the next batch and ask for the cut again. I also really enjoyed their PORK SAUSAGE and FILET MIGNON WRAPPED WITH BACON. Their pork sausage was juicy and flavorful. Excellent way to try things other than steak. I used to like their LAMB CHOPS because the flavorful seasoning. I tried it at this location and was really disappointed. The lamb wasn't seasoned like I remembered and really had strong lamb taste to it. It was just not as good as other items. When you come here, it's for a large all-you-can-eat meal, as well as having a good time with your party. I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience here; however, I was slightly disappointed with some portions. This is such a special dining experience that I will come back again.",4.0

Once we were seated, it took a long time to just get waters to our table. We ordered cocktails and had to remind servers about it twice. Tables are very very close together so it is very difficult to walk around the restaurant which is why I feel like we had lack of service. We were sat in the back corner and barely any meats made it to us- we had to keep requesting specific kinds and even had to ask for one 3 different times before it came to us.We reserved for a special occasion because it was my fiancé's birthday and we are from out of town. Unfortunately, they did not give us that experience whereas other tables surrounding us had birthday and anniversary desserts. They did not even ask if we were celebrating anything before seating us to check. We didn't want to even bother asking because at this point our parking was about to go over the limit, since everything was taking forever.

1544,"I tried their online delivery service for Christmas Eve.  The food was supposed to arrive at 7:30pm.  They use a third party for their food deliveries which was Postmates.  Now, the food arrived 40mins late! Yes, 40! And this was for Christmas Eve. So, dinner plans for a family of 3 were ruined on Christmas Eve.  I had been prepping our table since before 7pm. Yes, tapered candles, charger plates, more than two utensils, more than one plate, flowers in vases on the table.  We were ready around 7:30 excited for the food to arrive. 7:40 no food. 7:50 still no food. And I called Fogo and spoke with a lady who tracked the driver's location. Apparently the driver made several stop overs like he was trying to multi-task in delivering food! The lady was apologetic, and blamed it on delivery. She apologized, but that's about it.  Fogo did not make any effort whatsoever in terms of giving good customer service and customer satisfaction.  I gave my phone number to that lady who said she would get back to me.  She never did.  I emailed Fogo with my online order number and the issue I experienced, no response to that email.  The lady gave me Postmates' phone number and asked me to call at the same time she was filing a report.  Guess what? That number she gave was for merchants only so of course they didn't talk to me. If this was any other restaurant, I wouldn't expect much.  If this wasn't Christmas Eve, I would be able to shrug it off, and maybe eat a little snack since the food was late.  But this was Fogo.  Wouldn't you expect more from them because the name Fogo is quality food and quality service? Lastly, the food arrived and I was still on the phone with her.  I  said the driver just arrived and we are soooo hungry! She said, ""Awww!""",1.0

1547,"Do you love meat?? Then this place is really for you!  Hand carved meat that comes right to your table - meats ranging from beef, chicken, steak, lamb, pork, all the proteins. I came here during restaurant week for my friends birthday and had a great experience. Albeit this place being quite pricey ($40 during restaurant week, $60 usually), it really was worth it to try it out. My friend made a reservation for about 10 people and when we got there, we were seated immediately and were welcomed by a waiter. He got our drink orders, brought out their amazing cheese bread, and we were able to all get separate tabs for our meal. He told us how it worked since we never came before. Pretty much you have circle card, one side is green for more meat, the other side is red for I'm full, don't serve me anymore. So if you want the meat to keep coming, keep it on green! There was a *salad* bar where we could visit as many times as we wanted. The salad bar had cold cuts, prosciutto, fruit, cheeses, salmon, rice, all the good stuff. I didn't eat much of the salad bar food because I wanted to save my stomach for the meat. People would walk around with a knife and a huge hunk of meat and come to you to ask if you wanted some - if yes, then you would tell them the wellness of your meat (well done, medium, rare), then you take your tongs and take the meat when the worker carved it for you. I got to try top sirloin, bottom sirloin, garlic sirloin, lamb, etc. Some steaks were a bit salty, but others were super tender, fatty, and bursting with flavor. My personal favorite was the garlic sirloin - it was a huge cube of meat, marinated in a bunch of garlic. Super tender and had the best flavor - I seriously dream about that steak. While eating, they brought out garlic mashed potatoes, polenta fries, and caramelized bananas. The caramelized bananas may not look appetizing but they were amazing, and they actually complimented the meat so well! I would most definitely recommend. I ate a whole plate full of them. We also ended up getting dessert (thanks to restaurant week). The menu included chocolate mousse cake, key lime pie, of cheesecake mix I got the chocolate cake - it was a super thin slice, but it tasted pretty good and I didn't need too much after that huge dinner. The cheesecake was also a thin slice, but they gave you a huge chunk of you ordered the key lime pie. Overall, this place was great! Amazing food (seriously so amazing), great service, and a nice ambience - the only thing is that it is quite pricey (for a college student, like me). But it really was worth trying and hopefully, one day, I get to return... I might have to wait for the next restaurant week to come back. But it will be worth the wait, I'm sure.",5.0

1549,"To be completely honest.... I'm not impressed. I've been to a Brazilian steak house before back at home and it blew me away so I decided to give this place a try since it was slightly cheaper.... but I can see why. Everything at the salad bar was eh ok. They didn't have much selection and everything that was out seemed kinda old or not as fresh. The salad/spinach that was out was all wilted and dry looking and there were a couple of other things that looks mushy/ slimy.The meat was probably the most disappointing part since that's what people come here for. It was all dry except for their house special sirloin (not sure if that's what it's called) but the only appetizing thing served. All the other meats were just either too dry or just too hard to even bite into. Very upsetting since the meal in total was almost $130. I really expected more but this place did not deliver. However, they were nice enough to offer complimentary dessert since it was our anniversary. But honestly the desert was the best part of this very expensive meal.",5.0

1551,It was my first time at Fogo de Chão here in San Diego. I will admit that it is a crazy crowd of people at the door waiting to get in. I had a reservation and still had to wait.  Once we were seated our server took our drink orders and we didn't receive it for a while but luckily other servers noticed and stepped in and got us what we needed. From then on it was a great experience food is great and multiple people like servers waiters managers checked in made sure we were taken care of. I love that because we were very aware that they were busy and I felt I was being patient and understanding but for them to go above and beyond to ensure we were satisfied was great.,4.5
1552,"Great thing about Fogo de Chão is that while it can be a pricey dinner option, the company is always running specials and sending discounts. I highly recommend getting on the list to receive information via email about their specials. This is the first and only Fogo de Chão I have had the joy of visiting. It certainly is a treat! Best option is to fast all day or eat very light because the mounds of meat and exceptional salad bar are robust enough to fill you up on the scents, alone. I've been for both special occasions and genera dining and find the team to be attentive and  caring, no matter your reasons for dining in. Only issue here is parking. Meter parking is abundant in this area, but hard to come by. You'd be better off parking in the nearby parking lot (you can see it from the main entrance of the restaurant). Once inside, the space is is open with taller ceilings and the perfect mood lighting. I absolutely love the gold-ish toned light fixtures. The decadent ambiance lends a feeling that you should be wearing an evening gown. I've never been to brunch or lunch, so I cannot speak to that experience. For dinner, the Churrasco experience, which grants access to the market table and Feijoada Bar, is about $60 per person. You can go for add ons or a more simplified dinner at varying costs. The restaurant is kid friendly, and you will see people arrive from time to time with kiddos. Those 6 and under can eat at no cost; half the main price for those aged 7-12. Now to the food. My favorite cuts are the lamb chops, picanha, ribeye, beef ribs (Oh my goodness! Massive and succulent) and, occasionally, the filet Mignon. They will also make you a Mexican coffee if you ask. You also have a good choice in sides. The garlic mashed potatoes are so amazing -- with pepper and chives. And do not skip out on the Pão de Queijo -- these cheesy rolls that are so soft and light and fully of flavor. The market table is amazing: soups, salads, sides and accompaniments, including endives, Bibb lettuce, cold-smoked salmon, capers, olives (also stuffed olives), cured meats, aged cheeses (I especially enjoy the Manchego and Parmigiano Reggiano), roasted garlic, peppadews, marined mushrooms, kiwi, pineapple, asparagus and so much more. Dozens of options.  Also, the drink and wine menus are fairly comprehensive, though I wish there were additional offerings of Zinfandel. And the location is ideal if you are interested in San Diego's nightlife. Enjoy your dinner, then walk to any of the many, many nearby lounges, bars and performances spaces. Make a whole night of it.",4.0

1555,Customer Service was poor during the first part of my experience here. I was a bit disappointed that the waiters kept ignoring our table by not giving us enough meat and walking past us or just absolutely not seeing us wave at them and asking for more meat. Not sure what the hype was all about to be honest. All the meat that we ate were absolutely salty as well. The only thing I truly liked was their salad bar with interesting stuff to eat as well as their soft soft bread that they gave us several times which filled me up so I wasn't able to even explore all the meat. The price is not worth the hype. I don't know if I'll be coming back anytime soon. Parking is also limited with garage parking and walking a couple blocks to the venue.,4.0

1557,"Greetings all. Today, Nov 7th was a special day.. it was my girlfriend's 30th and as she joins the 30 years old club, I wanted to make sure it was a special occasion so I wanted her to have that Brazilian barbeque experience. I've only had good experience in the past and was it worth the money ?......Let me start with the host working the front desk.. booked a 915 res.. ask if we could wait inside in the lobby... her answer.. no... just wait outside (we got there on time btw) .waited an additional 10-15 minutes. while waiting outside... seen a couple of other people who walked in and got to wait inside.. mind you it was freezing cold outside.. and we looked like a bunch of bums/clowns .. starving; just looking into the window..(window shopping so to speak) felt very neglected. I get that it's the age of covid and safety measure are suppose to be met..but she ""the host"" was non attentive. Just staring at us with that look of annoyance. table for three.. finally As we are passing by a bunch of vacant seats... the host walking us to our table sat us down in a dark corner of the establishment next to a family of 12 with loose children sitting, running and kicking the wall.. right next to us... it lasted for about 30 minutes.. as we sat.. our primary server gave us the lowdown on what to expect  as per the new rules and steps for getting food...I get it.. first round is salad and carbs (cheesebread) that whole shmeal lasted for about 30 minutes.. it was hard to understand her but we played by eye:.remember guys.. last call is 10pm. Sooooo  yeah:. We came to eat barbeque:. Not just rabbit food.. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I KID YOU NOT, all I had within the hour I was there was a bite size piece of chicken... a small piece of lamb... and some burnt top sirloin..The food was burnt.. who the fuck eats jerky at a Brazilian steak house. That's just round 1.So I waited.. waited and waited patiently until someone with food came to our table. They just stare at us and it became a staring contest. No food.. just a bunch of sides..Then it dawned on me.. I just wasted half an hour eating bread and cheese at a steakhouse..A little later.. A rather more considerate man came and ask if we were doing good... and I had to express my concerns.. NO no we are not.. At that time it was around 1015pm. (They close at 1030) I've only had bread and some cheese in my stomach.. it was not until I started to express my frustration to a server and finally got some food.. at that point.. I just wanted anything that came our way.. I was not expecting this at all... after reading some recent positive reviews from other people.. Is it because of the color of my skin or the way we were dressed? listen guys... I've devoted 20 plus years in the food industry.. I know customer service very well i won't tell you where I work but 20 freakin years of good service so I know what needs to be top priority. Im not from San Diego.. I love the city like my own in Orange County.. but Fogo de Chao in San Diego is GARBAGE!!To recap.. Rude host.Lethargic service.. slow as f***You don't get what you want unless you complain. Otherwise it's leftovers or burnt pieces.They will offer you a shit load of sides to try and fill you up prior to the goodies..The food was not fresh past 9PM only when you start to complain will they bring u fresh cuts.Guys... save your money. This was a very disappointing dinner.. let alone a birthday dinner... I wanted to make this day special because you only turn 30 once.. gods plan.. Save your money.. We had a choice whether to eat here or other spots like Korean barbeque or Japanese steakhouse.. it was my poor judgement and I will never forget this.. Never.. as this was my first time in San Diego..For people like you and I who earn an honest living not relying on unemployment aid. this is a bit much to pay for what it was worth. Had it been a better experience I wouldn't have wasted my sleep writing this shit: I gave a two star rating because my guy help lower the bill for the lack of service.. otherwise it would have been a one.. if this doesn't help, I pray they step up their game and serve you guys better..To the team at FOGO... nice try.... but it will be my first and last time..",3.0

1559,"The staff and management are masters in the art of deception !!! I am very disappointed with this place. With covid, there is no physical menu, so when our waiter offered us to take the premium option, we thought it was the all-you-can eat option at 60$ and agreed on that. He, of course, didn't mention the price and it feel kind of out of place to ask for the price of the menu in this ""classy"" restaurant. First mistake, because for the premium option, they actually charge 60$ per person + a 195$ wagyu meat filet bundle !! But let's say it was a 195$ misunderstanding. But then, you have to understand that everything they bring to your table with the 60$ option is included. But not with the premium option ! Now that they have found a cash cow, they won't let go that easy; they also brought many things on our table (drinks, shrimps...) , NOT MENTIONING ONCE that we would have to pay extra for it and that it was our responsibility to refuse the food and drink if we didn't want to pay for them. WHAT A WAY TO DECEIVE PEOPLE. They brought this lame and tasteless shrimp cocktail, that we tried and let on the side (it was not fresh), and that we ended up paying 21.5$ for. This also happened with a 14$ liqueur that we thought was included in the premium menu (but it seemed that we had to guess that they would charge us). I feel extremely deceived. Never going back.",2.0

1561,"I've frequented this restaurant in other cities and this location did not compare. In terms of atmosphere, the place is very crowded and the tables are so close together that it is difficult to maneuver. The service was quite poor. Our waiter failed to give us a medallion and it took about 30 minutes to receive one. We had to tell one of the persons offering meat, who just went to another table and snatched theirs. We spent 2 hours at the restaurant, and during that time, we were only offered 6 different meats. Additionally, the meat was very much charred and sounded like chips when my partner and I bit into it. One guy didn't even know the name of the meat he was offering us. The selection at the salad bar was also limited. The saving grace of this restaurant was the drinks. That is the only reason I am giving two stars instead of one. All in all, I was highly disappointed and will not be returning. For the price that we paid, we certainly did not receive comparable service or taste.",2.0

1569,"BUYER BEWARE!! Our server almost hustled us into ordering an extra $350 worth of food. I told our server it was my first time dining at the establishment and he never brought me a menu just asked if I wanted the ""regular experience"" or the ""premium experience"". I asked the difference and he said the premium experience ""included the wagyu steak and tomahawk steak cuts"". I said premium and then he asked if I wanted the shrimp and lobster appetizer or shrimp ceviche. My gf asked if it was all included and he gave a run around answer stating it would ""come with everything she would want"" so I finally asked to see the menu. The menu showed only one ""traditional experience"" and then add on options for wagyu and tomahawk cuts both around $150 each.. The appetizers were not included either even though he presented everything as if it were included in the ""premium experience"" as he so called it. I work in sales myself and quickly realized what he was doing. After I ordered the traditional experience with all it included he never came back to our table once but instead sent other servers over and would avoid walking nearby or looking over at us. I assume he knew I knew what he tried to do. On top of this we were sat 25 mins after our reservation and originally were sat in a cramped and stuffy side room the size of a walk in closest with 10 other people so I had to ask to be moved to the main dining area. And after that 1/2 our sides were served cold. The meats were good for the most part and the other few servers that helped us besides the one we placed our order with were helpful. Overall very disappointing first experience. My gf and I had been looking forward to this for a while. I watched and listened to other tables get sat and they were all provided with a menu from the start and there were no such mentions of a ""regular or premium experience"". I know a hustle when I see one and Im just glad I eventually asked to see the menu before I was conned out of hundreds of dollars",4.0

We had a reservation and it ended up being backed up, but that was not the issue. The issue was that my family and I were stereotyped in this restaurant. Right when seated no one came to our attending. It has come to my knowledge that when coming to restaurants like this, black people are not given good service because they don't tip. Little did they know my family was well and ready to tip a suffice amount. But the service we received changed our minds. We had asked many times just for some lamb and every time ""I'll tell somebody to come over."" No one came at all. Constantly looking at the table next to us where servers were coming up to their table constantly offering them meat but turn a blind eye to my family table, we were just shocked. When we had a enough and we're ready to leave was when all of a sudden we were offered meat and servers were coming.

1582,"My Aunt & Uncle were visiting from out of state and we decided to try Fogo de Chao. We had 7:15pm reservations for the 3 of us and checked in with the hostess at 7:10pm. We were told it was going to be over an hour wait even though we had reservations. What is the point of having reservations when you are going to have to wait that long? Luckily, we were able to get a table in the bar area and ordered a round of drinks. The bartender was attentive and kind. I felt bad as they were taking the brunt of the complaints when it wasn't the bartenders fault for the extremely long wait. After we waited 45 mins he offered to go check on our position in the seating list and he approximated at least another 45 mins. Hungry and frustrated we were determining if we wanted to stay or go. The bartender offered to bring us some cheese balls, plantains, & polenta to snack on as we waited for our table so we decided to stay. We were finally seated an hour & a half later. I do have to say that the meat was delicious and the assortment at the salad bar was wonderful.

When we arrived around 8:40 it was a madhouse in the lobby with no real discernible line and people crowding the entrance (fire hazard?). Someone that I believe was working started shouting at the crowd of people to form a line to check in for reservations. We waited in the line for nearly an hour and were about to actually finally walk in to the lobby to be able to check in when a very disgruntled couple came out and told the whole line that wait times if we had a reservation would be at least an hour from when we checked in. It seems that management decided to overbook and didn't properly train their staff for one of the busiest days of the year for restaurants.

I went last week and although waiter disappeared at times i was able to get all the meat i wanted. If you want a specific cut just ask. Speed of service has greatly improved. Salad bar is restocked and always has all options available. Whoever was hired has done a very good job and should be commended.,4.0
1597,First of all i must say meat quality is a 10. Only lets you go up to 5 stars here. Only reason this is lower is how long it can take sometimes to get meat.

We went to try to rib eye but we did not get it for almost 1 hour. We ended up spending about 1 1/2 hours there due to time it takes. Again food quality is the best. You can cut the filet mignon with a finger. Everything is fresh and very tasty. Price is up there a little but trust me it is worth it. Just make sure you have the time.,1.0

When i got it i was surprised as i thought it would be sliced as when they bring it to you as the restaurant.  I got 3 long pieces about 1 inch thick almost looked like New York steak.  I was still ok with this and thought i would cut it up for them. I noticed right away the steak was hard to cut and when we tried to eat it, it was also hard to chew. 1 of the pieces we actually thru away after holding on to it for a day. I sent a message online at fogodechao but no one ever answered me. This is the only time I have ever had any issue. Again eating at restaurant has been spectacular but quality of meat seems to have taken a big hit I could have spent a couple more dollars to get the filet mignon instead and i even put a couple dollars tip just to try to help.",4.0

1600,"This review is for my most recent visit to Fogo de Chao during Restaurant Week in San Diego. My group had a reservation for 7:30pm and we were not seated until closer to 8pm. There was some delay due to our group being smaller than originally planned. I was somewhat understanding about this explanation. My annoyance really only came from not having transparency with the reason for the delay, the estimated time frame to be seated, and being completely ignored on the time frame of being seated, even when I was right in front of the hostess. After being seated, I went straight for the salad bar. I know some people feel the salad bar is a waste of stomach space at a place like Fogo. I personally can't eat only meat for a whole meal. Some of my favorite things at the salad bar were the black beans on rice, these little chili peppers that packed a lot of heat, the mushrooms, and the pineapples. The peppers and pineapple went so well with all the meat.At our table, we were immediately greeted with Brazilian cheese balls, plantains, and mashed potato. I love the Brazilian cheese balls. They're best hot.  My table actually ended up getting the full menu, not the Restaurant Week Menu, and using two $25 off coupons. Once the meat starts flowing, it doesn't stop. It was great to try the filet mignon, ribeye, bacon wrapped chicken, rack of lamb, I couldn't really tell what I was eating after the first plate.Although I was stuffed, the overall experience at Fogo was just okay. A lot of cuts were extremely dry and still being served. I did get smarter and only asked for medium rare cuts, but it was painful to see how much meat was wasted from being overcooked. Some of the meat I had was way too salty and some were not seasoned well at all. This experience is probably due to all the meat being mass cooked and delivered. For the same amount of money, $50+, I would rather go to a nice, more intimate restaurant, get a specific cut I enjoy eating, and have it cooked and seasoned perfectly.",5.0

1602,"My second experience here topped my first, which already was delicious. Once again, we opted for the full churrasco experience, which includes tantalizing slices of an assortment of cuts of perfectly cooked meats (cut in front of you at your table) and access to their feijoada bar. Choose from a variety of salads, soups, vegetables, fruits, at your own pace while servers bring the meats, as well as other treats like grilled pineapple, to you. Definitely try their polenta, and their yummy mashed potatoes. My advice: Don't eat big meals earlier in the day and save room. Their decadent desserts are worth saving for for as well. A little bit of everything adds up to a very large meal. Tonight was a special occasion, and a decent chunk of our very large family took up most of the rather long table in their private room. We received excellent service, led by the friendly, efficient, and observant Andréa, who made sure that the whole lot of us had everything we needed at all times. It can be chaotic to get drink orders when everyone arrives at different times, and to time things well around speeches and prayers and laughter, but it didn't phase Andréa and her team. Thank you for a delicious meal and relaxed atmosphere, and COVID-19 protocols that were simple to follow.",4.0
1603,"I came here for dinner. We had reservations for 7:30 pm but got here before our reservations. We only waited a few minutes before we got seated. I was impressed with this restaurant. So fancy! We got seated at a table near the window. I only drank ice water this time since Diet Coke fills me up fast when it comes to buffet style. There's a salad bar filled with salads, vegetables and rice and beans but hardly any fruit. There were only watermelons and kiwis but that's all I saw. I got a capris salad, salad, rice, bread, mushrooms and cucumbers. When I brought my plate to the table, the guys immediately go around asking you if you want meats. I got meat wrapped in bacon, pork in Parmesan cheese, etc. I was filled with so much meat. They also brought out mashed potatoes. For dessert, two banana plantains and sweet potato sticks. Not too sure what it was. Everything was so delicious. Once my water glass was half empty, the guy refilled my drink right away. Once you are done eating meats, you flip over your card to red which means they will stop bringing meats to you. Service was excellent here as they pay attention to you. I literally felt like royalty. It was nice to come here and splurge on meats. I'd come back. I highly recommend this place.",0.0
1604,"My other half and I came here last night for the first time to celebrate our anniversary. We found this place through Yelp and reviews and figured we would try it out. The reason for 2 stars is because our waiter was very unattentive. Never checked on our waters for a while, while he stood directly behind us for 45 minutes talking to another server and the host. We had sides served to us once and we never saw the woman again LOL. It seemed like we were getting the scraps of steak and it was hard and chewy. We sat at our table for a good 30 minutes without being served anything while our plates had dried chicken bones. We came for the ""experience"" and we both sat there thinking we probably would've been happier at red lobster or something lol.We basically paid $160 for 3 pieces of little cut up steak, a piece of chicken, a tiny piece of lamb, a piece of Parmesan chicken, and a scoop of macaroni side. LOL... such a disappointment.",4.0

1609,"Fogo de Chao is my husband's favorite restaurant, and I have to say that it also ranks up there as my top 3 favorite places to dine. It was my husband's special 50th birthday so of course my husband, mother in law and myself dined here and we had the best experience ever!Eric our server was polite, friendly and really went the extra mile to take care of us. My mother in law had a hangnail that she ripped in the car on our way to the restaurant so I asked Eric for a band aid so that we wouldn't bleed all over the salad bar and table. He was so wonderful as he not only brought out 2 band aids but an alcohol pad and some neo-sporin to take care of that! How that the wound was taken care of we got to business! All the delicious cuts of meat were served along with all the fabulous sides. We also feasted on the wonderful salad bar. We were SO FULL but HAD to have birthday dessert. So we ordered the flan as well as the molton chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream which really and truly hit the spot after we ate all that meat! I'm not even really a dessert person but I would go back just to have coffee, wine and that dessert sometime! Eric as well as all the Gauchos took such great care of us; even though it was July 4th weekend I didn't expect it to be SO busy for a Monday but really, the food, service and pace of the restaurant was perfect! I can't wait to go back! THANK YOU ERIC for making my husband's birthday so fabulous for us all!",2.0
1610,"My husband and I came here twice while we were in San Diego for Comic Con recently, for dinner and lunch. Both meals were very good.First off, the salad bar had lots of good options (yes, I realize that this is not what people come to Fogo to eat). The asparagus was appreciably better at the dinner service than the lunch service, as were the black beans. When I told the server about how good the black beans were, she said that ""well, some days are better than others."" I appreciated her honesty and saw how it does differ. Another notable mention are the pro de queijo croutons (presumably made from leftover bread served at the table.) They are quite good.There were lots of other good sides served at the table, like the polenta fries and fried bananas. Cocktails were also yummy.The meat was tasty (I ate mostly sides) and well-cooked. We both wish there were fewer options made with pork.Service was very attentive. Everyone ensured that we had full glasses and plates. We were also given a complimentary for our wedding anniversary, a lovely touch.If we return to San Diego, we will be back to this Fogo location.",5.0
1611,"Came here recently to treat out our family visiting from out of the country. Everyone had a great experience especially with the assortment of Brazilian meats! Their favorite were the lamb and house special. The only caveat is if you have smaller children, there might not be too much for them to eat. I have two boys, 6 and 4 years old, and they initially are some fruit but they didn't seem to enjoy the meat by itself. Fortunately, there was some rice so I mixed that in a bowl with the Brazilian beans and bacon dish, and they ate it all up! If you sign up for their email newsletters; they will occasionally send emails with various offers happening so be on the look out if you're looking to try the Brazilian churrascaria experience!",4.0
1612,"This place was so cool! Went here for my boyfriends birthday dinner and they bring you all the food you would normally get at the buffet because of COVID-19. I felt like royalty because every few minutes someone came over and offered us something new and delicious. My favorite was the Parmesan Crusted pork and the bacon wrapped steak- sooooo good. They also had the bartender bring a cart around and tell us about the rum drink specials and it was a really cool experience, the strawberry hibiscus one is great!I also want to thank them for accommodating us because our reservation was at 8pm, but we got there around 6pm to see if we could be seated early (as a waitress and former hostess I know how annoying that could be lol) but they were super great about it!",4.0
1613,"I went today for lunch and the food was amazing as always. But I'm particularly impressed by the service of the meatserver Jose! Jose was very educated, friendly, and provided the best experience we ever had at FOGO considering we've been there many times!!! If you are lucky you will have Jose as your meatserver!

1614,"I was very much pleased with the service, staff, and way this restaurant was run. I have never once been to a dining establishment that was as professional as this one. All food  that was presented when choosing the dining experience was warm, cooked to personal choice of the customer and tasted delicious. The staff was present throughout the entire time and I have no complaints. I have to say it was a pleasure becoming friends with Mike ""The Chicken Guy""... this man was beyond professional and personable and was a guy that I felt I knew from way back. I also got the chance to talk to the Assistant General a manager Violet, who seemed to always be within an arms distance if there was ever an issue. She was friendly and ensured that my dining experience was nothing more than amazing. I highly recommend and will be coming here every other week!",4.0
1615,"Came here most recently with my family for Christmas Eve dinner and it was very nice. The service was friendly and attentive and the food is always solid. This time I felt like the cheese bread and a few other things were more salty than normal for some reason though. I hadn't noticed it in the past. My parents commented on how salty everything was, though they seemed to enjoy it still. The leg of lamb and picanha were my favorites, though the pork ribs and outside skirt were also great. They caught on quickly that my mom prefers medium well done meat and were quick to get it to her, which impressed me. The butternut squash bisque was different and nice, and we had dessert, liquor, and coffee, as well as wine and prosecco. All in all it was a fun way to dine and a very pleasant family occasion. My dad even splurged on fancy $200/oz cognac which was a special experience. Thanks Fogo for a memorable evening!",0.0

We also wanted to give a special thanks to our servers Nick and Victoria who were very attentive making sure that we had clean plates, various sauces and kept our waters refreshed. Thank you guys.

1618,"I know Fogo has been around in San Diego for awhile and I've never gone only because I really wouldn't eat my monies worth in food. I don't really like to binge eat since I'm not in my 20s anymore haha..With that said, my husband and I came here for dinner because a good friend gifted me a gift card here. I was stoked! I made reservations and boom - date night at Fogo on a Saturday. The staff was really nice and incredibly attentive.. and fast. What I mean by fast is when I flip my card to green-within a moment's notice someone's there asking me if I was like the meat they're holding.. and they weren't even in my peripheral!! I was amazed haha. Anyway- I had a game plan. I first went to the market table to get some greens because I can't just eat meat for dinner.. needed some healthy stuff in my body. Love their assortment of vegetables! I wanted to avoid bread because I ain't filling myself up with starch! Lol. Once I ate my plate of vegetables I was ready for the meat. Every meat that I had was delicious! I was really focused on the beef because I love beef and I don't eat that much beef on the daily because moderation is key. Anywho.. all the beef was fantastic especially with their chimichurri sauce. I tried the parmesan pork and holy moly that was delicious. Everything was tasty and our overall experience was great. Lastly I had ordered one of their cocktails ""passionate"" and that was very well made. My husband loved seeing the hard liquor cart wheel around three restaurant lol. Great dining experience, but still a bit too expensive for my blood. Go here for special occasions!",4.0

1634,"Gee-golly! This place really blew my socks off!If you are one of the many enthusiasts of the perfectly-cooked meats, this place is a must-go! Do be warned - you'll be frustrated at the end due to being stuffed and unable to eat anymore! (I know I was, haha!)The interior of the restaurants can be interpreted as a warm-welcoming atmosphere to a romantic, dimly-lit evening with your loved one. The theme of chestnut brown and deep scarlet is seen throughout the place, leaving you wondering what's in store for your gastro-journey. The tables feature an unwrinkled creamy-colored table cloth with slightly ergonomic but historic wooden chairs. The demeanor and atmosphere of the Gaslight District really blends into this place if you catch my drift.Let's get a move-on to what's really important - the meats.I truly beg for forgiveness for the lack of photos - this is partly due to my voracious appetite in wanting to sink my canines into these delicious meats. Of course there is The Market Table that has your classic in-house artisan foods and vegetative commodities, but the meats are what sets apart this steakhouse from others (don't get me wrong - it's great but not the star of the show!). The meats brought around the restaurant are a transformative experience. Each meat's potential is brought out to its fullest - leaving one to think how one can also bring out their own potential like-so. It fills you with determination. Regardless, each meat was cooked to melt-in-your-mouth quality and I can't seem to stress how much it made me cry. Three favorites of mine that I do recommend:*PLEASE do keep in mind that I did arrive with my entourage during their dinner phase. This may not truly reflect the lunch phase that they have.- Filet Mignon (Tenderloin Cut)This is a no-brainer! Absolutely blasting my mouth out of this corporeal world! This cut is a must-have when coming here. I do believe this is their best cut of meats due to the fact it made me think about how much cows bring to the table when it comes to the world of culinary delights. To that, this meat makes the gentle beast shine. - Cordeiro (Prime Lamb Steak, Leg of Lamb, Chops)One of the more creative and experimental dishes! I come from a background where lamb is not commonly consumed - so please keep that in mind! Absolutely amazing, not a single fiber dry or tasteless. Its acidity and seasoning were on point as if it were on a needle! One of the employees also recommended their specialty mint-jelly sauces to go with it - I cannot recommend that enough as well! The lamb with the addition of the emulsifying effect of the mint-jelly pairs with the meat to leave you with a satisfying but refreshing bite! I'm quivering from the memory of it!- The Parmesan Pork (Unsure what cut this is, sorry!)Though at face-value it seems like a very odd approach to this type of meat (as I thought), but to my dismay, this method of integrating the two flavor profiles kept bringing me back for more! The flavor of Parmesan was neither overbearing or weak, but worked in tandem with the flavor of the pork to elevate each other and the shared element of umami! How peculiar! Do be on your best behavior when the server comes around with this meat, you can only ask for so many! Haha!!One thing I found rather peculiar is the practice of wrapping meat with bacon. It turns out this practice, known as ""barding"", allows the addition of moisture and flavor into whatever is being wrapped. Neat! Just an interesting observation and nugget of information I was fed at this establishment!Do keep in mind that the servers are accommodating if you would like one of their meats cooked more well-done ( or less, I wouldn't see why not, haha!)I do recommend making a reservation in advance to prevent needless waiting for your stomach to experience this culinary gem. It takes less than five minutes and can save yourself from a headache! Oh no!For parking to get to this establishment, consider one of the nearby parking garages as street parking is near-impossible to obtain. Though the pandemic has transformed many restaurants, this places did not sacrifice quality or service in its way to protect its customers. If you're an individual who's wondering whether or not you'll receive the same experience - don't worry! This place adheres to the public safety guidelines with its employees showcasing utmost concern, I truly appreciate the concern and gravity of measures taken. I thank all of the employees who made this food experience unforgettable!",5.0
1635,"I cannot even describe how amazing this restaurant is. Amber, the sales manager helped me throughout the whole process. I decided to use Fogo as my reception dinner. I had to cancel my big wedding and chose to do a small dinner at a restaurant. I made my plans before the second shut down and the team easily accommodated my party outside. They closed an area down for me and made it personable. They were able to socially distance everyone. The whole staff was amazing from start to finish.

1637,"Although we were served water throughout our almost 2 hour stay having the lunch buffet, the couple next to us was essentially ignored. Never once did anyone ever check up on them or serve or refill their water. They also did not get served meats more then 2x whereas we were offered a variety of meats at least 8x during our stay. I saw the couple ask if they were in the section of the server and she played it off that they work as a team but I do know in fact that both we and the ignored couple were in her serving section. I don't think she meant to do it-non-discriminatory but she was definitely not paying attention. Even with us our mashed potatoes, bananas and fried polenta came out to us halfway through our meal. The restaurant was definitely crowded but the couple was sitting before we got there and the restaurant filled quickly within the first 30 minutes we were there. I'm just relieved we were not the ones ignored as we have not been out for quite a while. I sympathize with their experience but I did see that they were offered a free dessert and one of their meals was compensated. Good job trying to make it right.Salad bar was great! I tried a little of everything and I really liked the pickled veggies as an option to eat with the heavy meats. The rice and beans were a nice accompaniment as well. My fave meat was the filet mignon as it was one of the few meats that was not dry. I think with the amount of people and maybe the lack of staff the meat got ignored and many were overcooked considering the quality of the meat. But it was reasonably priced for what you get. Parking is rough but we were able to snag one a block up on 6th at a meter for $2.50 for 2 hours. I would come back when it isn't the holidays and hopefully have better quality food.",0.0

It wasn't until our actual dinner that we had such a bad experience. We barely had service and definitely did not get our money's worth. They kept skipping our table and we had to keep asking them to bring us meats. Didn't really help that we were only getting the same 3 meats either. Only got one refill of water the whole night. I remember numerous times where we were just waiting for someone to help us so we weren't even eating. I mean, there's a salad bar but I wanted to save room for the meats.

1646,"I went here to celebrate mi little sister's birthday. It was our first time here (not our first at a Brazilian steakhouse.) We walked in and the lady which I assume was one of the hosts greeted us and I said I needed a table for 3. She asked if I had a reservation and I said no because I didn't know we needed one, which is okay and the lady said they were only accepting reservations. I said that was okay but I decided to check online if maybe I could reserve for later in the night and I found out I could reserve a table for that exact time I was there. I made a reservation and got a confirmation on my email. I went to talk to the same lady and told her I was able to get a reservation online now and here is when it got really weird. She said ""Sorry we are not accepting reservations anymore"" and I said ""What do you mean?, you just told me you are only accepting reservations and no walk ins"" then she said ""We are not accepting reservations or walk ins"". I got really upset with her answer because it didn't make any sense at all. I asked her to give me a better explanation and she said they stopped accepting reservations after 5pm (it was 6:30pm at that moment) and that it was not her it was her boss's order. After her just made up explanation, I told her that couldn't be true because I just saw a few people coming in and just showing their confirmation email and she would let them in without even checking at what time they made the reservation. I was getting really upset because at that point she just didn't want me and family to get in. I don't know maybe because they we look or maybe she was being racist I have no idea. But before I showed her how upset I was, her boss came out and asked what was the problem, I told her I had a reservation and she let me in right away. I have no idea what was the other lady's problem honestly.However, inside everybody was really nice and professional. Food was great.",2.0

Upon entering the lobby, the place was literally packed out the door, with a crowd of people waiting out in the rain. We checked in at which point we received ""ok you,re checked in"" and nothing else. Very cold. I started talking to some people who had reservations well before us and had been waiting for over an hour an a half. To add injury to insult, a walk in party was sat before the reservation that had been waiting an hour and a half. When asked, the hostess lied and said they weren't seating any walk-ins. Furthermore, they refused to estimate how long the wait would be, even though multiple groups had been waiting for over 2 hours. The level of customer service was appalling. We decided get a drink at the bar and they couldn't even be bothered to get that right. I would never go back to this fogo and I would give them less them 1 star if I could.

1659,"The entire experience was disappointing. We had reservations at 7:00 and didn't get our table until 7:55. When I asked the hostess how much longer it would be until our table was ready, she replied, ""I don't know. They just tell me when tables are available and I get the menus."" After sitting at our table for 10-15 minutes, we had to flag down a food server to get our drink order. Our drinks took another 20 minutes. The salad/side bar was very low on food and didn't look fresh. The meat was slow to come around.  Our waitress seemed irritated and not happy with her job. She didn't check in with us at all during our meal except at the end. The bathrooms didn't have paper towels and were a mess. I was shocked at the lack of professionalism and customer service. The only positive out of our dinner experience was Jasmine. It was her first day training as a food server.

1662,"We decided to try the $39 Restaurant Month special they were promoting to try this place out for the first time. I've always been wanting to try cause I love me a good steak and i can eat!Reservations were easy to make online so I was able to make mine a couple days before. We were ready a bit early, so I called ahead and asked if we could come in earlier- I can already tell the lady was super nice as she said ""of course""Parking seems like it would be a hassle but we came on a Monday evening and I found some street parking. The location was easy to get to once you get off the freeway. First impression was a very nice restaurant, not too fancy, even for the price, but it was too dark for my liking. We brought our 3 year old son and our surrounding tables didn't seem too fond of that idea but oh well.Camilla was the first to greet us as we got seated and we explained that it was our first time and she explained everything to us! She helped us out with our noobie questions. She was very informative in describing the process and the different sides. Thank you for your help Camilla!The process seemed easy, theres a salad bar we were welcome to anytime and you flip your card green for meat or red if you needed a break. It took a while for us to receive our meat because there was a big party in front of us and the meat ran out before the server got to our table. One of the servers got a little frustrated because we didn't know the type of beef he was offering, MY BAD! it was good tho! Some of the meat was a little too red for my liking but they were still good. One of the servers came to offer us some pork, when I politely declined- he asked if there was something he could special make for us- which I thought was very nice. I just wanted to know if we got to try them all- I still am not sure we did.There were other servers coming around with other appetizers, such as a shrimp cocktail, also a little glass of champagne, but we did not get offered any. I am not sure what was on our table that stated we had a different menu of some sort, or if we did, we did not get explained. Unfortunately, our very helpful server Camilla, seemed to have left for the day cause we didn't see her again after that first interaction. Totally sucks- because that ruined the experience for us.When the bill came, they charged us for the regular price but when I asked about the restaurant month special, they told me I was supposed to let them know in the very beginning- which I did. I assume it must be a different menu? Not sure- the lady was very hesitant but she said she would speak to the manager and after, she adjusted it for us, so I appreciate that- even though I am sure you did not want to!Everything was okay, it wasn't as great as I had expected so I probably wouldn't go back. Cool experience though. I just feel the service for the regular price should be outstanding but it wasn't. Except for Camilla and one other guy who refilled our waters- super friendly and funny!",5.0

1674,"Outstanding customer service and the place is really nice. Prices are pretty high but the meat is great quality, seasoned perfectly, and you can have your slices cooked how you want to. We came for an early dinner, just before 3. Valet parking is $20 but its pretty convenient. The cooks have the giant skewers with several types of meat cooked on an open fire. As long as you have the green side of your coaster showing, every cook stops by to offer whatever they have. They let the meat cook more on one side. That way people can get pieces of well done meat and I can still get the medium rare slices.I'm a big lamb fan so I had a some of the lamb chops and some leg of lamb. Definitely the best cooked and seasoned lamb chops I've had. Great lamb flavor.Can't go to a Brazilian steak house without doing the Picanha. It's basically the prime cut of the top sirloin with the fat left on top. Then it's cut into big steaks, bent into a ""C"" shape, and stuck on a skewer. As it cooks the fat melts and drips onto the meat to add more flavor. Pretty damn delicious.I also had more delicious meats like the ribeye. The other top sirloin was good too. These ones were just a giant pieces of meat, no ""C"" shape. The Brazilian drink - Caipirinha was pretty good. Not sure how to describe the taste. It's made with the Brazilian liquor Cachaça, limes, and cane sugar. Tastes almost like a mojito. I had two... The salad bar had good fruit, mushrooms, and artichokes... The mashed potatoes are good too. But who the hell goes to a place like this just to get full on that stuff?!",5.0
1675,"I would not recommend this place if you don't eat meat. They had delicious fire cooked meats galore!The little buffet bar was pretty nice. There was a bunch of cured meats and cheese. Cured pork leg similar to spanish jamon was tasty. I also liked the cured Portuguese style chorizo. Both went well with the brie. There was a lot of veggies to chose from.The star of the show was all the meats. Just keep the little button on your table showing the green side. Every gaucho passing by will offer whatever meat they have. The gauchos are walking all over the restaurant with giant skewers of meat. When they see your button green they stop and offer you a slice. I had some filet mignon, picanha, top and bottom sirloin, leg of lamb, and pork lion covered in parmesan cheese. Sounds like alot but they only do thin slices for a quick taste and they move on to another table. So you can taste a little of everything. If you looking for a particular meat, just ask and they will make sure they come by with that meat soon.Brazilian cherry soda and the Mojitos are very good too.",5.0

1679,"This restaurant was quite the experience! Definitely worth a visit, but it's good to know a few things before going. 1. It gives the illusion of being super fancy, so we dressed up and many of the people at the 6:30 dinner reservation were in baseball caps and hoodies. 2. You have access to a huge ""salad buffet"" that is included in your meal. It's much more than salad including all types of cooked and raw veggies, charcuterie, smoked salmon, fruit, soups, and more. You could easily fill up on these items. 3. The ""appetizers"" they offer are NOT FREE (aka jumbo garlic shrimp is $22...which you will find unknowingly on your final bill.)4. The happy hour can ONLY be experienced at the bar (totally separate from the restaurant) and you CANNOT bring the drinks over to your table. 5.

1690,"I went on Veteran's day with a reservation at 7:15, not knowing about the special for veterans. It was my first time eating here and it did not leave a good impression. I took my bf for his birthday as a surprise and we arrived with a mob of people waiting at the front of the restaurant. It took us about 30 mins to officially check in and they had us waiting for an hour after getting a table for us. There were no points of reservation as they were taking parties that just stated an earlier time than it was. Understanding the circumstances, we did anticipate a slower service, but once we were seated it took some time for a waiter to acknowledge us. The couple next to us was getting a lot more attention compared to us, considering they were 2 feet away. Our original waiter came around about a total of three times throughout our dinner and never brought us the drinks that we ordered. Yet, billed us for them even though he never checked up on us.

1704,"I have been wanting to go to the SD Fogo for a while now. I went to the one in Beverly Hills around 8 years ago, that was the only Fogo I have been to, and I only went there once. However, I remember almost everything about that one experience because it was excellent in every way. I figured that I would have a similar experience in SD, but I was mistaken.     Had reservations made for weekend lunch. They were offering half off in lieu of Veteran's Day, which was awesome on their part. I hit up two friends who are also veterans and made a reservation online. Very easy and took less than five minutes.     We parked about two blocks away but I think there's a valet, that might only be available during dinner. I would have called them and asked about the parking if I wasn't with my friend who can always find street parking. We were seated immediately upon arriving.      The inconsistency among service staff was an issue. Most were great. The guy who seated us as well as a female waitress and some of the other servers were great. But there were also some servers who looked like they hated their job, and us since we were part of said job. No smile, no positivity. Only gloom and doom and a piss poor attitude amongst these few rotten apples. It was pretty surprising. Even at places like Dennys, I don't see this kind of tomfoolery. I tried my best to ignore these two clowns. This immediately made my meal much worse than it should've been. That alone is a deal breaker.     The second issue is what I deal with at other churascarrias most of the time. Meat doesn't come around often enough, and when it does, they are skewers and meats which are alright but definitely not what I came for. And even these lower end cuts were not coming around very often until the latter part of our meal. I had to ask for several different meats to be brought over. To their credit, the servers always came through and got the desired meat to our table, but this shouldn't be something that one has to do while eating at a high end restaurant like this. If I didn't have experience with Fogo Beverly Hills and various other churascarrias, we would've ended up just dining on chicken and top sirloin skewer cubes for the majority of the time. After about 45 minutes, the good meats started to come by rapidly. In my opinion they should be coming by a couple of times an hour, not once an hour.     In regards to the food itself, it was incredible. Delicious pieces of rare steak thin sliced and a very nice salad bar/hot food buffet. Their specialty, the Picanha (cap of top sirloin) was insanely good. That's why I gave them two stars. Service here was worse than at Rei Do Gado, which I went to a couple years back.      This place has excellent food and I really appreciated the Veterans discount they offered, but was really disappointed by the issues I encountered. I don't think I will be returning this location.",4.0

We believe that they were trying to ""ice us out."" We have never experienced this before at Fogo de Chão. We left feeling frustrated with the service, and the manner team members treated us. At the beginning of the visit, they asked if we had any requests to please let us know. During our visit, we had only requested pineapple and filet mignon; they were bugged with us immediately. They ended up bringing enough pineapple for two of our party of six. Unfortunately, they never brought the filet mignon... As I said, the food was great, but the staff was very unfriendly.

There was part of a wall in the way so I felt like it madeIt harder for the protein guys to deliver, we were tucked away against two walls basically. Even the table behind us noticed we could barely get out and told us wow , hey we will be leaving soon so that you can move our table  . We sat there for almost 10 min waiting for some one to say anything to us or even order water. We finally get greeted go to the salad bar come back and we get our first piece of steak.... It is so bloody they don't even ask us if this is how we want it at first he just cuts a piece and we are all looking at this meat in disbelief that he wouldn't ask how we like it first. Now I have a very bloody plate , we prefer medium. Cuts the piece and walks away. They come out a few times and we start to notice it's the same 3 pieces of meat... and it's either rare basically or well done I felt like none of the steak pieces that were coming out were satisfactory at all it had no taste and it wasn't the right temperature it was awful! As I sit there waiting for a different meats to come out which never come out until I start to ask hey is anything else coming out then they ask well do you have a request it was almost like we were only there for the salad bar which ofcourse by this time I'm getting full.. I've had to sit there and wait so I'm hungry and eating basically all salad bar stuff.  The few pieces of Meat  had no taste or under cooked / over cooked. I was bummed and thisJust wasn't the experience I was expecting. I visit Fogo in Texas often and this could've been better. I wish I had picked another place to celebrate for my birthday on vacation to SD.",0.0

We've been here a couple times before and we've always had such a pleasant and lovely experience.Our server was very nice and accommodating. The cuts of meat were very good, and the flavor was divine. The salad bar had a lot of options and I enjoyed some of the goods from there as well. I tried their pineapple and lemonade drink and it was refreshing. But the the best part about Fogo is there fresh cheese bread. It is to die for!

1723,"Fogo de Chao is a ""chain"" Brazilian Steakhouse.  Well known in Brazil and made its way to America in 1997.  Between 1997 to 2013, the chain opened up another 29 locations in the US.  The New York City location became its flagship location (which I had the opportunity to visit when I was still living there in my past life).  To be honest, I'm not a fan of visiting chain restaurants or writing reviews for chain restaurants.  Evidenced as such because I never wrote a review on the New York City Flagship Location.  In this scenario, I had to make an exception!  I made it to the San Diego Fogo de Chao location with some fellow Yelp Elites foodie friends for dinner.  Similar to my previous experience in New York City, the food and service was nothing but the best!  We opted for the ""Full Churrasco Experience"".  This includes the ""Market Table and Feijoada Bar"".  This bar essentially has all of the salads, sides, beans, rice, and anything else that you can possibly imagine to accompany meat!  Tip: Save some room in your stomach for the actual meat.  It's very tempting to fill your plate to the brim!After the market table experience, the servers start coming around.  There is a ""coaster"" type card (green on one side and red on the other side).  Green means you're hungry and the servers can come around to present to you the particular type of meat they cooked.  You can also choose how ""cooked"" you want the meat.  For me, I always choose ""medium rare"".  When you're full, flip the card over and the red color is displayed.  That means you're full and the servers need not bother you.For the drinks, I choose Caipiroska (Caipirinha made with vodka instead of cachaca).Delicious food.  Great drinks.  Great service.  ENJOY!!",5.0
1724,"The food and experience was wonderful! The restaurant was beautiful and clean. The food was absolutely delicious and the semi-chaotic fashion in which you receive said food is entirely invigorating!  The only problem I had however was with the hostess.

My group also had a reservation for 9:30 and we made the aforementioned reservation an hour and a half prior. Despite this, once we arrived we still had to wait just over an hour to be seated. If I had to suggest something off the menu it's definitely the Tres Leche Cake!!!!",5.0

1731,"Almost passed on this place from a review reporting spotty service and dry meat.  Disregard it. Glad we went here for Father's Day brunch. Prices were at dinner prices even though we went for lunch. That's expected for an event.The restaurant was upscale and the service was great. Waiters all work together so you don't have to wait on that 1 person. Very observant in watching how customers look like when they have a question or need something.The meat was very juicy and soft. Some may get a little tough if you let it sit for awhile. Servers came very often so was pleased in getting what I wanted. The self serve bar wasn't bad, but I think I prefer Re Do Gado's selection more. Fogo had a lot to offer, don't get me wrong but just personal preference. Overall had a great experience! They gave us a complementary Father's Day meal for a return visit.",0.0

1733,"I give this place a 2 because the food was good and our waiter was okay. I think my biggest issue was the fact we waited so long just to get our drinks also the fact that the manager on duty from what I understand never even touched tables until closing time. I watch him sit at the table with 3 females and drinking wine with them. It's amazing how busy the place was he was just relaxing with 3 girls. I believe one of the three worked there because she was greeting all the servers by name. If the manager was as attentive to us as he was sitting with them making sure we had all we need I think this experience would have been a 5 star. Hopefully, you discuss with your manager Tuesday, June 22 @ 8 to close about spending less time drinking wine on shift and start taking care of the customers.",5.0

1739,"This was our first time at Fogo de Chao. The food was very good, the salad bar generous. No sushi (which is typical at nice Churrascaria's in Brazil) but the rest of the food was tasty. The meat servers seemed to slow down, come less often as the restaurant got busier (so not just that they stopped at more tables but that there were also just fewer of them, and fewer of the fancier cuts of meat). Food was overall 4 or 5 stars. The service though was not amazing. In addition to the meat, there were also folks walking around offering infused chacaca aperitifs. Based on the way these were offered, I assumed they were included/free. They were not, and the price was actually more than the normal beverages. We took them in part because our initial drink orders took forever to arrive at the table. The server did not tell us we could just start on the buffet if we wanted the normal churrasco dinner so we sat there for like 10 minutes with a hungry kid waiting for her to come back to take our order. And at the end of the meal (in addition to the surprise drink charges) it took them three tries to get the bill right (first bill was obviously not for our table, second added an extra drink we didn't order). If I am paying that much for dinner I shouldn't have to study the bill to make sure you aren't cheating me. And, the tiny chacaca aperitifs that you walk up to the table to offer me, with no warning they cost more, should be free.",5.0

1741,"With restaurant week coming up, I figured I'd review this amazing steakhouse! Having been to both Rei Do Gado before, I would say to go to Fogo if you want better quality meat and a more fancy dinner/lunch. The atmosphere of Fogo is a lot more cleaner and their sides are to die for! The restaurant is very upscale, but there are a lot of people wearing casual attire as well. When we came inside, the server explained how the restaurant works. Everyone gets a little circle next to them: if you turn it to the green side, they will serve your meat, if you turn it to the red side, they will skip your table. There is a salad bar towards the center of the restaurant and is buffet style, so you are free to visit as often as your heart desires. Lastly, the sides are to die for! My ultimate favorite would be the Brazilian Cheese bread (I wish I could have taken home an entire basket), but the caramelized banana comes in a close second. Make sure you're ready to eat a lot because this place is extremely pricey! You're paying for variety and delicious sides, so you might as well take advantage of it.",5.0
1742,I have experienced this restaurant in San Francisco downtown. That was amazing! Then I want to go this one and it was terrible. Servers don't know their menu. We ordered unlimited dinner Menu and my wife ask then for shrimp from salad bar  as we did before in San Francisco.  Then server said yes it is salad  and they have cold and hot. He suggested both for her. He brought huge seafood meal cold and hot for only one person. Server said salad but they charged me $80  something  for this. We do not make problem money therefore we went there but it was cheating. Never go again never! I will prefer Rei Do Gado in San Diego Downtown.,1.0

1746,"I'm the kind of person who thinks they can live without red meat but who am I kidding?  I may abstain for 10 days at the most and then find myself absolutely craving a juicy burger or a rare ribeye.  So on my future visit...and no doubt there will be one...I will make sure to have gone without red meat for a minimum of a week or so and then go hog wild...or cow! Wow....the meats just kept coming. From the top to the bottom of the loin, the shoulder to the rib, the round to the shank, they have every cut of meat except the cheeks!  This restaurant redefines the Navy custom of ""Parading the Beef"" as they literally walk around the restaurant with a huge cut of meat skewered in a sword and offer you a slice prepared rare, medium or well done.There were other meats like lamb, pork and chicken too. I will have to try those on my next visit as they were getting rave reviews as well. And for those who are able to resist your carnivorous cravings they also offer a seafood alternative. Chilean seabass was offered to our fellow dinner guest. And let's not forget that salad bar. I would return for this alone. The veggies are big and beautiful, from artichokes to asparagus to hearts of palm. This is not a cruise ship kind of buffet bar! I imagine that the employee meal at the end of the night must be pretty spectacular.  We started the evening in the bar to take advantage of the almost 1/2 off drinks. My first time trying a caipirinha, a Brazilian rum with lime juice (think mojito without the mint) and it was the perfect refreshing drink on a summer evening.  We didn't get to try the food items as we were doing the buffet but checked out the menu and there were lots of offerings between $5 to $8....of course including beef.  Will definitely return for happy hour food items and then if I'm still hungry just hit their salad buffet!Let me finish with the service. Absolutely incredible...we were positively treated like royalty as Evan W. noted. The GM checked on us throughout our dining experience and our drinks (including water) were constantly filled.  No doubt we received 5 star service.

My favorite one was the garlic top I think but it was a garlic one. Also yeh rib eye was delicious!!!! All steaks were delicious!! Oh I almost forget!!! The cheese bread they give is delicious!! Super super good!! They ask for what condiments you want like steak sauce mint jelly and all those yummy condiments!!! Everything was perfect! Even the service! It was great!

The waitress took an hour to bring out the coke I asked for 3 times, she stuck her boobs in my face multiple times to get plates out of the way instead of asking me to pull it closer for her, the people bringing out the meats were practically whispering when they walked by asking if we wanted meats (at a table of 9) so they skipped us half the time since we couldn't hear them, then we did hear them and said yes they passed us anyways! Half of us had the green sign up still but since a few didn't they skipped us completely multiple times even when we went out of our way to ask for more.  I was forced to leave a tip on the split check for their shitty service, no lower than 3%, I wanted to leave nothing. She didn't even want to split the checks we had to force her and we told her since the beginning it was going to be split. I asked for a printed receipt and I never got it. The food was honestly not that great. Most of it I can make better ar home. I'm not saying it was bad but not worth it for shit*y service.

Cesar salad, tabouli, mushrooms, star fruit, papaya, pineapple, kiwi, tomatoes, and cheese. No sushi, seafood, or hot items. Decent selection of semi seasoned steak, pork, chicken, and lamb readily available with a flip of a card. Side dishes consisted of unseasoned mashed potatoes, caramelized bananas, and cheese bread.

I can see all my friends expressions to why he threw it in such a manner, this is a top star restaurant you would think waiters, host, servers would know proper etiquette. Anyways !

Like what ! We knew we paid $500 flat including a tip, the tip was atleast $25 because we decided to not leave a good tip for the service we had received.

1779,"I received the same response as Barrett.  Asking me to email their feedback with contact Info.   Will update whether they respond to me or ignore like they did Barrett. ================================Was looking forward to a great lunch here for my daughters 10th birthday.  Overall a pretty bad experience.   The best quality meats like filet and bone in rib eye didn't even come out untilThe end of the meal...it only came out bc I asked.  They brought out a select few meats and kept repeating those meats.  I finally asked why we weren't getting the full rotation of meats and they had no answer and said it would be out soon.  We waited and waited and finally came out.  The filet was great but we were already full from eating all the other meats.  The ribeye was cold inside.  I like my meat rare but this was actually cold.  So we asked for a second round of filet which didn't come out for another 15-20 mins.  At this point, we were annoyed and done with the meal.  As a cherry on top, I had a 12 yr old, and a hey charged me an adult price for him.  When asked about it, the server said she didn't realize 12 was a child and made the changes.  Maybe the child price was not a big deal but since I was already annoyed at the entire meal, it just amplified my feelings about the whole experience.  I guess One good note was we got a free dessert for the birthday girl.   Wouldn't go back here.  Only reason we chose Fogo instead of a local Brazilian place nearby was Fogo charged a child price for my 12 yr old.  For an ""elite"" restaurant, The service was subpar(especially one of the meat carvers, who kept giving us an attitude).... Our server was great outside of charging us the adult price for my child.",1.0

1781,"***** More times than not, I am easy to please. For my husband and I, our dining episode at this DTSD location, was Fogo de WOW!Made reservations for 8pm. Got there 5 minutes 'til. Got seated within 5 minutes. Had a quiet table toward the back, which was perfect for us kids of romance. The place was NOT CROWDED on this night AT ALL. Surprising for a Friday evening, considering All Star weekend, baseball activities were popping off around town. Our main server Destiny, was attentive, amusing and affable, thus, our grading for her alone was an 'A.' Everyone here pitches in to make you feel at ease and catered to. Remarkable service.The go-grab-it-yourself goodness of cheeses, greens, fruits, carbs and minor meats that lines the floor on the way to your seats, this is where most folks begin their Fogo mission. A neat ensemble of appetizing starters. I won't elaborate (see other Yelpers' descriptions of it), you need to try it on your own.In a nutshell, you want meat? Take your rounded Fogo coasters(?) and flip it to red or green, red for stop, green for go. The wait staff knows whether or not to slice & serve you or to keep it moving. You've got your choices of pork, lamb, chicken or beef, all seasoned & prepared differently. Some DECADENTLYummy! Some I nibbled once and didn't feast twice on. 1st 2 baskets of cheeseballs they dropped off were baked soft & nice, the 3rd was a little crisp & hard. Loved the chicken & potato salad, veggies and cheese from the salad bar and sides they table delivered were pretty good too.$52.95 per person and we ordered 2 watermelon frescas at $4.75 each. $108.43 total with a $15. reward I had. For us, Fogo is worth trying & having, more than once. Can't wait to hit up another location. A dining destination that is delightful for a dinner date or any special occasion! *****",1.0

We arrived right on time for our reservation and we were seated within one minute, all of the staff were very friendly and attentive to us. The food was outstanding. This place is an amazing place whether you like meat or not. The  Servers known as gauchos roam the restaurant with skewers of meat hot off the grill. When signaled by a green or red sign on your table, the gauchos will come to your table and slice the meat for you. The portions are so generous and the meat top quality!  The salad bar that is included with the experience has a plethora of vegetarian items, bread, soups, black beans and buttered white rice. The garlic mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had and make sure you have The fried polenta and the caramelized bananas! We would like to especially acknowledge a staff member named Violet who made our experience exceptionally entertaining! Violet was full of knowledge and knew exactly what to recommend from the bar and dessert menu. She has a one of a kind charm and personality that leaves you wanting to go back over and over. One tip I'd like to leave you with is before you go sign up for the reward club within 12 hours we had a coupon in our email for $15 off our first dining experience and they also send you a $25 gift card for birthdays.

1796,"Have been to this location before and it was good, a solid dining experience which is what I expect from this chain , having eaten at many locations. However, last time I went, this past weekend, they seemed to be understaffed. Not enough meat going around the room and some of it , I could tell, was cooked in a great hurry. The lamb was totally dry , some other meats also burnt/charred. A few cuts of the beef were delicious though, as were the sides and salad bar. Wonderful service ! You can tell the staff really cares. However, the room was jam packed with people, literally zero air flow. Seemed kinda dangerous given that we are still in covid-times. I thought indoor dining was only supposed to be at 50% , but the room was full! I was thinking they could at least open the doors or provide air filtration. :( worrisome.

1799,"This is my husband's and I second time trying this place. We came here on new years for our wedding anniversary dinner and for Valentines Day 2022. I really love their steaks and salad bar. their drinks are to die for, my hubby always gets the smoke and honey whiskey. The atmosphere is great but always packed so don't expect to have alot of space between tables. I Only Have one feedback and that would be the servers. the first time around I was annoyed at the server we got because he kept ignoring us and not bringing what we asked for (I was planning to spend a good buck for our anniversary) so we ended up leaving sooner than we thought.  and on Valentines day they were giving out some special Valentines drinks (we thought they were complimentary because the girl was giving them around so when she asked we agreed to get a couple) well now i know not to ever get any drinks that they bring you without ordering them because that insignificant drink cost me $26. Never again! We just kept being ignore all around. the people that go around offering food barely showed at our table. we went a good 30mins without any steak. I really and I mean I really like this place but their service is just awful. Not only was my anniversary ruined but also our Valentines day dinner. If you are going for the food then great but good luck with the service (either they are selective with who they want to give a good service  to or you have to spend thousands for them to look at you). And make sure that before you take any drinks that you didn't order you make sure they are free because they will not tell you.",4.0

This place is honestly okay. I don't see the  reason to comeback. I have been to 3 other Brazilian steak houses and this place has little to no flavor. The salad bar its very beautiful but the food has little flavor  and little options. I believe any local deli has better salad bar options. There was like 2 or 3 things I found good that salad bar and it was fruit, cheese, and ham nothing made by cook. The meat quality is not consistent some are good and some are more salty than a Ritz cracker. I have better steaks at Chili's. Disregard everything I said the worst part is that it was my wife's birthday and  she was not even asked if she wanted a slice of cake meanwhile a couple next to use got a free slice of cake for someone birthday.

1815,"This review is for my recent dining experience during Covid. We came here last Saturday for a no-occasion, casual dinner since we hadn't been in awhile and we had some gift cards to use. I was unable to make a reservation on their direct website as the different time slots were showing as unavailable, but I tried going through OpenTable and I was able to get a reservation. We ended up sitting outdoors on the makeshift dining area built on the street across the sidewalk from the restaurant.  The tables outdoors were spread about 6 feet apart I would say and it wasn't that packed that evening so parties were still seated at every other table. With regards to social distancing/Covid, being outdoor seated, you're kinda subject to the passerbys in Gaslamp who may or may not be wearing masks, mixed in with the groups of people who are out drinking and socializing. My gf also did point out that the meats being taken around outdoors were being exposed to the air, and the guests might be breathing on them when they're brought to each table. The salad bar indoors was unavailable so they had waiters occasionally bringing out 2 or 3 items and you could pick what you like. The flow of the waiters with the meat skewers was also pretty consistent during our dinner. My favorite meat options are the picanha and lamb so I did request the waiters to bring it out, and they usually came out within like 30 seconds of requesting it from the waiter which was pretty awesome. We also asked the waiter if we could have like half of a picanha roast at our table and he was cool with doing that. Aside from my favorite meat selections, the other meat options are also very tasty, and I would say that the only bad meat option is getting a slice of meat that's more towards the well-done side. The side dishes of the mashed potatoes, the fried square brick things with grated cheese on top, and the cheese bread rolls were great accompaniments, but I had to keep those to a minimum to save room for the meats. I could've sworn that they normally had more meat options coming around from the previous times I had dined there, but that evening it seemed like they only had the same 4 or 5 items rotating, but no biggie. I guess the only downside of that evening was not being able to use both of our gift cards when there was no mention of not being able to use multiple in the fine print and the waiter also insisting that multiple gift cards can't be used. Oh well. Overall, 5 stars always when I dine at Fogo. I'm not really picky on like restaurant ambience or anything; mainly just that the food is good, and the meat here is superb. No question, go check it out if you can.",4.0
1816,"I was excited to come here to try this nice upscale Brazilian steakhouse all you can eat carved meat. although I'm not  really a carnivore. My experience today was totally disappointing thought my lunch was overall mediocre. Food-  Each variety of grilled meat looked amazing and tasty,  but most of them are dry and not tender & juicy. The sausage was pretty good. But the polenta sticks and garlic mashed potato looks cold and boring, no Bueno !it wasn't good at all. I was charged for the full churrasco experience that includes the market table with boring fresh veggies, Cold meats and cheeses. $34.95. CS- I gave them 4**** for the prompt service it was impressive and the waitress was really helpful and suggested veramonte primus red wine $12.50 pairing my steaks. Overall it was just okay 3 stars ! Sorry And the salad was too boring for real. Well, Thanks for the $15 discount online if you sign up on their email list.

1819,"Please note, this is a Restaurant Week (RW) point of view!Made reservations for a 7:30pm seating on a Friday night. I'm glad we did. Not sure of it it's b/c of SDRW or if it's just a typical Friday night, but it was PACKED! Like, when we were shown to our table, I was able to follow the hostess, but the bf got stuck behind a few other people and got lost before he found me kind of busy.The staff didn't miss a beat, though. And Pete started telling me about the Brazilian Steakhouse experience before he caught up. Man, the staff here? 5/5! They work cohesively, quickly and even though we opted for the RW menu, they came over to see if there were any options that they could help bring our way. We didn't try all the 10 options, partially because we didn't want to, partially because they didn't come by and mostly because they don't skimp on most of the portions and we were quite full on what had already come by. I stopped by the market/salad bar and when I came back, the bf loaded my plate with beautiful chunks of meat. I didn't get much at the salad bar, though it was nice to have some veggies in between the meat. Since I wasn't there for when the items were being piled on my plate, I can't tell you what my favorite piece was. Though I can tell you that they were all pretty well seasoned, some with strong saltier flavors than others. The chicken was well cooked and not dry. I'm usually not a fan of chicken but it was pretty good! Sometimes you can pick the doneness of the meat, which is awesome. The rarer the better on some of these, otherwise they get really chewy. I had a few pieces like that and the ribs I had were burnt. I decided not to even try those when another round of ribs were presented. I like some char but not the completely blackened and dry kind. The mashed potatoes were nicely seasoned and had a ton of fat in them. That's why they were so good! I liked the bananas as well, and the polenta was ok. It was crispy but lacked flavor in comparison. There must be insane food waste here, as they kept offering to take away my salad plate. I didn't put a lot on there, as I wanted to reserve space for the meat, but they kept offering to take it away even though it was pretty much half full. I guess people go to the bar, then don't eat a lot of it once the meat starts coming by. It is an AYCE extravaganza though, and they will let you eat your body weight if you keep accepting it!Since we did the RW option, we had our choice of 3 desserts: chocolate mousse cake, NY cheesecake and key lime pie. The regular menu allows for more meat options and dessert options, but the option we chose still allowed us to get a good feel of the place.We opted for the chocolate mousse cake and key lime pie. We didn't like the chocolate mousse cake as much, but even with our overstuffed bellies, we devoured the key lime pie. It was refreshing after all that juicy and flavorful meat.",3.0

1825,"I've been to many Fogos at big cities and this one surprised me. Usually it's an upscale environment with some nice ambiance, people are dressed up and it's a fun experience. After all it is a pricey meal. Here, it was really casual to the point where tourists looked like they just came from beach. I guess that's because it's San Diego. Still, I couldn't believe how loud and crowded it was. Felt like a chaotic zoo in there where you can barely squeeze your away through the tightly packed tables to the buffet area. Of all the Fogos I've been to, this one is by far my least favorite. It was so loud that we could never hear the servers when they announced what meat they brought, even after asking them to repeat it. We got a good laugh about it though.The food itself was good and pretty consistent with the other locations. As I'm sure everyone knows by now, you have to go when you've skipped a meal and are starving to fully indulge in the endless all you can eat meat extravaganza, and you leave one pant size larger and almost feeling ashamed of how many animals you just consumed. The meats were great and sides too. The cheese bread is still my favorite part though. That's the former vegetarian in me I guess.Service was great. Our server was attentive in every way and kept the cheese bread coming. I also liked how managers kept checking on us to see if there's any meat we hadn't tried yet or wanted more of. We requested the delicious lamb steak and minutes later a server came right to us with some fresh stuff. If only everything in life were that easy.Overall it's always a good and gluttonous experience here! It's not as nice as the other locations and they make you pay a lot for valet but hey it's still Fogos.",5.0

I absolutely love the cheesy bread, one of the best I've had. However, the salad bar was one of the most boring one if seen at Brazilian BBQ restaurants.Remember to ask for their chimichuri sauce and hot sauce, they are awesome. And if you're going on a non restaurant week time, ask for their bacon wrapped filet... I believe that's their ""secret menu""Parking was a pain as usual for downtown, so we went for their valet. However, there was a huge line for getting our car back after the meal... it was like a 15 mins wait... they should work on that a little.Anyway, overall I liked it, but of the two such type of restaurants in downtown SD, I have to say I prefer Rei Do Gado.",3.0

I had to ask for a side of chimichurri 4 times and had to wait an hour before I got it. We had empty drinks most of our meal and  even had to flag down another server to pay for our bill. I sat at a table with 3 other asians and it was funny because we saw our server being so attentive to other caucasian guests when we hardly got any service. We will not be coming back here again.,4.0

1832,"I had my birthday dinner here last night and it was a great experience. Excellent service, and great food. I tried ten of their sixteen cuts of meat available as all you can eat. The meat was delicious and the Parmesan crusted pork, top sirloin, New York strip, and bacon wrapped chicken were very, very good. The lamb chop flavor was a little off and I didn't enjoy that as much but it's probably not a consistent problem for them. They also had chicken legs that were roasted and they reminded me of a turkey leg from the state fair... kind of dry, but still good, definitely not my favorite though. I also really liked the buffet/salad bar. The soup, salad, salmon, cured meats, and vegetables were all excellent. The sides (mashed potatoes, fried yucca, cheese bread, and caramelized bananas) were also fantastic, especially the bananas and cheese bread. Also had a bottle of the house wine, a tasty complement to the meat.They have complementary dessert for birthdays and I chose the tres leches. It was the perfect end of meal treat. Our server Angelica did a great job and with the many waiters moving around the floor I felt the service was excellent.This is a great place for any special occasion if you really enjoy meat. I would go back.",4.0

1840,I have eaten here many times before. Always great food and excellent service. But this was the first time we have eaten since covid. But I was very disappointed this weekend for dinner perhaps due to covid. They no longer have menu our waiter explained the dinner service as we both ordered the Steak and tomohawk platter. They brought us other selection of meat but just to be sure we confirmed with waiter as we had already ordered the steak plate and did not want to get charged double. We were told that was a sample platter and that it would not be charged to our bill. To our surprise along with the two other guests that I noticed who where both very angry we all got double charges with a 300 dollar bill for 2 people! I believe this is very un professional and deceiving. I understand everyone is effected with covid but we are out to try and support the local businesses. Unfortunately after eating here for many years i will no longer return to a place that takes advantage of patrons!,0.0

1847,"This place was amazing.  If you leave hungry you have no one to blame but yourself!  The experience was very unique.  Servers come around and give you different kinds of meat.  Literally as much as you can eat.  You flip a coaster over if you want more and flip it back if you need a break.  The flavors are amazing.  Basically one of those restaurants that you have to try at least once.  Plan on spending some money because it not exactly a cheap place to eat.  Great for special occasions, birthdays etc.",5.0
1848,"I don't know if I've ever put in a bad Yelp review but this experience pushed me to do so.Let me start by saying this is our first time at this location. We used to live near San Jose and visited the San Jose location several times and LOVED it.You know what, I wrote this and re-wrote this several times. To get straight to the point, this location was a giant waste of time and money. We paid way too much to basically be ignored even with our green cards face up. After an hour and a half, we only had 4 different types of meats from the full dinner experience. I actually said ""let's go, because if I start talking to a manager I'm going to go off and cause a scene."" I was that livid. After an hour and a half we left hungry!! I'm currently at another restaurant only 30 minutes after our visit and I would have never EVER experienced this in San Jose. I will say, I saw the table right next to us with full plates and happy faces so I guess if you go here, best of luck to you and your experience!",5.0

1851,"So, i wanted steak for lunch. I like RIO DE GATO better but they are not open for lunch. I've been to this place once and the meat was goodI wanted that for lunch, and as I approached the hostess, she was standing there like a statue before asking if I needed help. No personality, no smile, no nothing. She really acted as if she didn't want me there.I was asking about the to go menu and SHE COULD NOT ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION. She had to look up everything on her phone. When she did not look up stuff up on her phone, she would ask the manager. They would talk for minutes (about what, I don't know) before coming back to me with the most uninformed response ever. How do you have a hostess who can't answer the simplest questions without help. Like, what meat comes with the 2 and 2 lunch? She had to go ask the manager. How much is the 2 and 2 lunch? She had to ask the manager.What a freaking joke.

Party of 11, We took our daughter here for her 13th bday, reservation at 6:00pm, 6 of us showed up at 5:55pm and were told that we needed to have all 11 to be seated and all were seated by 6:15 at the further table from the buffet.our waitress dropped one water on spilled all over table,  chair and phone, accident happened, not a problem. At 6:55 (40 minutes later) no one had came by to offer any kind of meat. The 5 teenagers were hungry. I spoked to the host and she sent 2 people over w the beef. Another 30' later, no one had came by, I spoke to the host again and 2 other staff came by w beef and chicken, then the waiting game continued. 20' later, the kids were full with the salad bar and some cheese puffs. All of the servers came out of the kitchen went straight to the tables by the salad buffet and out of meat before reaching our table. We ordered desserts and it came out quickly. Once paid, we waited another 20' but no one brought out the change, I had to speak to one of the staff to follow up on our change.Overall experience- terrible service! Food was ok, the staff were rushing to cut the meat and skipped people at the table (after waiting 20-40'); we had to ask them to pls go to the next person. Not the kind of bday dinner I expected for my daughter.",4.0

He was so attentive, caring and made sure we were not missing on anything. Clema, taking care of the buffet was so sweet and also made sure we got everything we expected. Diego another server responsible for the meats was also so attentive and was always checking if there was anything else we wanted.

We had no idea who our server was as after the initial greeting, we had to wave down anyone who would look our way to help us. The food was so-so good, but not $200 plus for two people. Very bait and switch as I was offered a complimentary rum cocktail that I was charged for. They also peddled shrimp cocktails, I can only imagine that cost.

1868,"My review is based solely on my pickup/delivery experience:I regularly eat at Fogo de Chao because I love the taste and quality of the food. However, the last two times I ordered for pickup/delivery, I have experienced a few issues. The first time I ordered for pickup, two side items were missing. The second time I ordered, for Valentine's day, my order did not come with rock salt, the dressing for my caesar salad, and our dessert that was picked out to match a bottle of wine I picked up earlier. I called and spoke with a male manager who claimed the dessert was in the bag that was picked up by the driver and could not send another one out. I couldn't tell if he was claiming I was not being truthful about the missing chocolate cake, or if he was claiming the driver, hired by Fogo de Chao, stole the dessert. At some point, a customer decides enough is enough with the mistakes and tries elsewhere.  I am probably going to order from Fogo de Chao again, but if issues continue with take out, I will start ordering from Rei do Gado.",5.0

We cave men up in here baby eating meat like a beast with a grin & no hesitation! I'm a big meat eater & this place gots it all from steak to lamb & chicken with bacon, meat galore! They have a little salad bar that's cute too it's cool. But you come here for LA CARNA bebe!To start with let's talk bout the customer service, it's real good from valet parking to the hostess, waitress & the people coming around bringing you meat. They are all polite, accurate & fast be ready because they come fast with the meat & all different kinds of meat & chicken. My favorite is the Lamb Steak & Chops & the Garlic Steak, wow on point! The chicken wrapped in bacon is also great. And the package you pay for comes with all you can eat beans, rice , salad & I believe mash potatoes with bread. Trust me you will be full, it is a bit pricey but worth it so make sure you get you're money's worth. So you ask me ""Andy how do I get my money's worth buddy?"" easy my friend, right when you feel full & you can't eat no more meat you go straight to the restroom & BOOM POW you unload & come back for round 2 baby! Don't hold back go full throttle & take that meat all the way in (keep your mind out the gutter people) & eat away! Over all a great experience great food, customer service & yes they have a bar with beer & mixed drinks. Yes parking can be a problem but just valet park you'll be good & kids 6 & under eat free.

1875,"I'm a Fogo fan, and this was my first time at this location. Overall, we had a great dining experience, but my husband and I couldn't help but compare it to our preferred location in Beverly Hills. The quality of the meats, sides, and caipairhinas tasted exactly the same. I love the cheese bread and the Strawberry Hibiscus caipirinha. My favorites meats are the picanha, pork ribs, bottom sirloin, and lamb shoulder. Unfortunately, the rotation of meats could have been better. We mainly saw the picanha and bacon wrapped something with my other favorites appearing later. You can also request your meats, but there were times that no one was in sight to serve to us and other diners. I'm just being picky because the Beverly Hills location always has someone as soon as you flipped your card to green side. Overall, everyone was very nice and friendly. The weekend brunch is relatively new for Fogo as they now offer warm options by the salad bar. It's also cheaper than dinner, and you get the same great food. I felt like there were more salad bar options at the Beverly Hills location, but this one had a better selection of fruits, which I ate a bit after as my dessert. With 5 star food and 4 star service, it's good to know that I can expect delicious food and great service at a different Fogo location.

We initially were greeted by one server but I think we counted like 6 people that attended us. One server took our drink order and said he would come back to explain the menu and process, but then another server came and said if we were ready to order before we got our drinks or explanations. We were so confused that I finally asked who our server was, and he said they were all working together. I've been here before and it's not normally how the service is. Our cuts of meat were sub par, most meats that were being offered were extremely fatty. We asked one of the servers to have lean meats brought over but nobody came. I ordered the salmon on the menu and it was salty and overcooked well done plus. In the end we felt like we were rushed because someone came and dropped the check, we were going to order dessert but decided to pass after the check was dropped. We paid and as we were leaving another server approached us trying to give us the bill again!!!! so much confusion and lack of communication.",4.0

We ordered a Coke I would appreciate it for her to let us know that it was the bottle and not refillable.They falsely advertised saying that they had fried plantains when they were actually fried bananas.We came for restaurant week and then they notified us that restaurant week for them was only for dinner for that day. So we were doing the brunch i'm not sure if there's any difference to that.Overall we spent over $100 and it wasn't even worth it it was so overrated. Also the service was definitely not the best. When I asked for extra "" plantains"" when we finally got them she rudely set it down on our table like she was annoyed that we asked for extra.Worst of all we're in a pandemic and they sat people right behind us and in front of us well at least one couple was towards the back by themselves the restaurant inside was crowded definitely not 6 feet apart.

We check in at 9:30 and the hostess, who was very rude, told us it would be a 45 minute wait. I understand that we were early, so I expected to wait until our scheduled time, but why make a reservation if you have to wait long past your scheduled reservation? I get it's a Saturday night and busy, but we did not get a text for our table until 10:30 saying it is ready. Thats a one hour wait from when we arrived. That's unacceptable for a 9:45 reservation time. The hostess was rude and unprofessional, and the overall vibe from the team seemed like they didn't even care about complaints because of how busy they are so it's the ""onto the next customer"" attitude.

1892,Excellent service and amazing food! This was our 2nd Brazilian steak house first being espetus in San Francisco so our expectations where high and they did not disappoint! We ordered the wagyu (which is an extra charge) however if you've never had wagyu it's a must! Beyond delicious! Diego and Robert we're exceptional!,4.0
1893,"My first experience was great, José e Francis were extremely careful and gave us plenty of attention. I was upset when I got the check with over $50 extra for things there we're bringing to the table without letting us know it was extra, but the manager helped us with that. I appreciate that. Food was great and I'm Brazilian and can say it's very similar. High quality meat.",5.0
1894,"Honestly, Fogo de Chao is not my favorite Brazilian steakhouse and I've been to a few even in Brazil.  This place is okay, I do enjoy their plantains and pao de queso (cheese bread) that they bring out.  A must to eat is their Picahna but sometimes, the other meats are grossly overcooked.  That's the food. Food I'd say would be a 3-4 star considering.  I've had better for cheaper.  You pay for the big spread of other food they have out there too. This  review is for the abysmal service we got.  It was a friend's birthday and we got a reservation for about 10 people if I remember correctly.  They put us all in the back corner, and pretty much forgot about us.  I had to flag down a few waiters/waitresses so we could get any kind of service.  Water. Sides. Meat.  We had worker after worker PASS us with the meat and we sat there... waiting.  We had about 1-2 plates that we finished and ate already by the time any kind of food was given to us.  I had to call the waitress and have her flag the other people to come to our table.  I had to do this a few times.  We weren't assholes, we weren't loud and drunk and rude.  My group of friends are very nice, so I don't see why we got such horrible service.  Was it because we weren't dressed nicely? We were very casual, but I saw people with Tshirts in there.  I just don't understand why we got such horrendous service.  A meal shouldn't take too long, but we were there for a long time because half of it was just us waiting to get some meat.  I've been to other Fogo de Chaos, and the service was never bad.  This has gone to the total other end of the spectrum and I am so severely disappointed.  FYI, even if your patrons wear casual clothes, you should still treat us with respect. Ninety percent of our table were medical professionals. Five nurses, 2 doctors of physical therapy, 1 nurse practitioner, and one corp level business.  4 of us collectively own a multimillion dollar company. Treat people with some respect, and stop judging by what we wear or look like.",5.0

1898,"[EDIT: I'm reading the other reviews and it's obvious that we didn't see half the meats shown in other pictures.. now I feel ripped off.  We got sausages, pork, sausages, sirloin, and sausage.]It was a strange experience overall.. I can see how it could be good, but it wasn't.The pacing was too weird to tell.. we seemed to get the same repeat meats early on (sausage?  Sausage?  Maybe sausage?) and very little variety.Then, halfway through the meal, it just... stopped.  FOUR Green signs up, empty plates, and the waiters would just walk right by.. over and over.  It's hard not to get a bad vibe when you've come there for the steakhouse, only to see it walk to other tables.Eventually, I think a server noticed we were scowling at four empty plates and took pity on us, went and directly got a skewer of something, but that's not how this show is supposed to run, is it?We ordered more cocktails to see if that would jumpstart the meat -- no luck.  Cocktails ($16?, pretty delicious) came, were finished, still slim pickings and empty plates.The meat we did sample was far into the ""Done.  Well Done.  Over Done"" side.  It's not bad, if that's your thing, but it was also super salty.  The salad bar was alright, but undersized for the crowd.  The sides (yucca, plantains, mashed potatoes) were good.  The winner was the parmesian-cheese pork - tender and tasty.  The beef cuts were all overcooked and full of gristle.Kids Price is half-price, and I don't think either of our little ones ate $29 worth of food, but we knew that going in.Compared to the nearby Rei de Gado, I don't see why we'd go back to Fogo de Chao.  Rei de Gado has a more extensive salad/sides bar, far better variety of delicious cuts (bacon-wrapped filet and such), and more regular visits to the table.",5.0

1904,2 star is not for their effort the staff puts in but the fact that if you have been to Fogo de Chão before pre-Covid it is nothing that resembles my past four experiences. Different protocols and their amazing salad bar that blows your mind isn't even available. And the way they bring the food to the table is not the same at all. This is just to let you know what makes Fogo de Chao that special restaurant has no resemblance of what they really are. I feel bad for writing this review but also know everyone's hard earned money and paying $50 plus per person is not the same. They do not have the servers bring Churrasco to your table and slice it to order. I believe because the experience is completely different they should adjust their pricing to reflect the difference.,5.0

1907,"I came here for my early birthday celebration. It was my first time coming to this place, let a alone a place as nice as this. The dress went from casual to dressy so I opted for something in a middle but still felt underdressed at times. The service was amazing and we had so maybe people help us to make sure we had the best excuse possible. They explain the way things work and then we wait for someone to come around with all the different kinda of meat. (The lamb steak was delicious.) If you need a break you just flip this card they give you that says you're okay for now! Now, I don't remember all the names of the people who helped but there was one woman who stood out to us and her name was Yesenia (I hope I spelled that correct) and she was amazing! She had this grilled cinnamon sugar pineapple that we just could not get enough of. She made our experience way more fun just by giving us all the pineapple we wanted. She was reassuring in the fact that I wasn't too underdressed and I shouldn't be embarrassed of not knowing how things worked and she was just the sweetest. We also had some wagyu that we ordered specifically for our table and WOW!! It was so amazing. One of the best things there for sure!",2.0

1909,This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in San Diego I always get the all you can eat meat and they just keep bringing you different types of meat on skewers fresh from the kitchen appetizers sides until you can't eat anymore and all the quality is very good definitely a different dining experience I would  come check it out,5.0
1910,"Quality is slipping - 2.5 stars------------------We came here as a special night out - we hadn't been to Fogo in over three years (last time was in Philly), and wanted to come back. They have made some updates to their offerings since our last visit. First, they now offer sea bass - an interesting twist, not unlike other steakhouses which offer seafood to capture a larger market. Second, they offer a hot station in the back which serves butternut squash soup (good), white rice (not tried), and black beans with pork (not tried). How was our experience? Let's just say it was ok, not great. The garlic mashed potatoes looked like they were sitting under the heat lamp for too long. The fried polenta sticks were incredibly hard - not sure if they changed recipes or if they were also sitting under the heat lamp for too long. The plantains looked flat out unappetizing. We did have doting service, but that was to compensate for the fact that the ""gauchos"" were nowhere to be found for half our dinner service. We were also surprised to see one of the managers actively bussing tables. Were they that short staffed?But most importantly, the meat was mostly overcooked and inconsistently seasoned. Rare became medium rare, medium rare became medium. The rock salt was unevenly distributed. And there was a slightly sour taste not clearly attributable to lemon / lime juice seasoning. This is disappointing, because steaks / grilled meats should be their forte. I'm hoping this was just a minor blip rather than a ""new normal.""",5.0

I actually changed it the day of requesting a later time and they were happy to accommodate. There was a little bit of a wait when we got there, but it wasn't too bad.Our waiter was so informative and awesome overall. He split our checks without any issues or complaints... and explained every step of the meal with enthusiasm. My boyfriend felt like he made our experience so much better and I agreed.The salad bar is top notch!!! I especially loved all of their cheese yum yum yum. We also really enjoyed the sides they served. DON'T FORGET to ask for their sauces... they have so many different kinds from A1 to chimichurri... loved all of them minus this weird green one that's supposed to be good with the lamb? Idk it tasted like toothpaste to me.Anyway, red means stop and green means go (you're like duh!)... haha they give you a coaster that you flip over. Leave it at green if you want the meat guys to keep coming to you. My favorite had to be the garlic sirloin and the new york strip... but mostly everything was good. Even their chicken (which I usually don't enjoy) wrapped in bacon was so moist and flavorful.Fogo is GREEEEEEEEEAT for groups and an awesome place to celebrate birthdays :) They surprised us with a slice of dessert each with our names written on the place. So cute! I enjoyed it more than Rei do Gado and we will for sure be back.Price: About $52 a person for unlimited meat and salad bar sans drinks, coffee, and extra sides.TIP: Sign up for their mailing list online and you'll get a $25 coupon to use on your birth month :) You're welcome",4.0

1917,"My wife and I love Brazilian BBQ and have usually gone to Rei Do Gado downtown for it. However, some of my friends said the food was better at Fogo De Chao, so we decided to try it. We went on a busy Saturday night. We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait, and we could wait in their bar. It turned out it was just shy of an hour before we got a seat in the restaurant. We only had one drink each in their bar, after I saw a beer was $9.50 (plus tip).We were seated in a corner and, as a result, all the meat-waiters constantly passed by us. We had to flag down our own waitress a few times to get enough meat. Her service was frequent enough, but we felt abandoned by the those serving the different skewers of meat. We asked about the prime rib and filet mignon that were also on the menu as included meats. We were told that those are by special order, and we'd have to wait about 20 minutes to get some. The salad bar was mostly just that. Unlike Rei Do Gado, you have to pay even more if you want any seafood (see the menu photo that I've attached). I found the meat a bit salty, and worst of all, the chicken pieces were  dried out. Several types of fruit on the salad bar were not very ripe either.The atmosphere inside is more like a beer hall, because it is so large. I find Rei do Gado smaller but a lot more cozy. There is no chance a waiter with the meat skewers will bypass you there.  Our bill at the end of the night was about $160, for the two of us. I find the service, meat quality, and what's included for the price far better at Rei do Gado. This was our one and only time we will go to Fogo de Chao.",2.0

They were generous with portions and meats we really liked.  My husband loves their lamb chops and the locations in LA and Vegas always took forever in serving us the meats and would only give us 1 or 2 of the specific meats we asked for and would make a comment about us wanting the entire platter even though it's all you can eat meats.  This location served us the entire platter of lamb chops and brought out more less than 10 minutes later without a single comment. The salad bar was a bit smaller than the other locations, but that did not diminish their customer service.  The staff was fantastic and was really attentive.

1927,"Happy Valentines Day!!!I have to say, writing a Yelp review while you're super stuffed is quite a challenge but here it goes...We chose to celebrate Valentine's Day at Fogo de Chao and made reservations far in advance. We know how busy it gets and even with a reservation, they give you a buzzer prior to seating you. A lady walked in with her son hoping to get seated but the hostess said that the wait is 3.5 hours. As part of the Valentines Day promotion, you receive a dinning card good for a complimentary lunch or dinner on your next visit with restrictions. The great thing about this is that you have about 6 weeks (Feb 5 - Mar 28) to redeem the offer.We were seated against the wall which was more comfortable than being in the center of the room where just about everyone rushes in and out. The sides are immediately served which includes caramelized banana, fried polenta, potatoes, and their famous cheese bread. Trust me, you'll need these sides and the market table to clear your palate and to help you chew less intensely. The passadores (meat waiters) bringing by large skewers of meat continue tableside service as long as you have your card on green = Keep it coming! or flip it to red = I just can't! This time the cards are heart shaped in honor of Valentine's Day. Unlike Rei Do Gado which uses a salt shaker-like tool to mark green and red, these flat cards are hard for the passadores to see from afar - which may have caused them to skip us every once in a while. The passadores will carve the meat while you use your mini thongs to hold and move the piece to your plate. The outer portions of the meats tend to be more salty. Special request or made to order is available.After chewing on picanha, lamb, lamb shank, chicken, and pork ribs (a little on the salty side) it was time to dive into the market table/salad bar. This includes mozzarella, artichoke, tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, quinoa and eggplant, kale salad, smoked salmon, charcuterie, brussels sprouts, roasted bell peppers, chicken salad, rice and much more. I really enjoyed the soup of the day which was butternut squash. Dessert is not included but they offer fruits which include papaya, grapefruit, pineapple, and orange.It's unfortunate to say that the service is inconsistent. Some of the passadores such as the one holding the picanha came by frequently. Other passadores holding other meats did not make an appearance. We noticed that a few of the passadores would start at the left side of the room, come up in the middle and the exited. We sat on the right side and a missed a few of the meats. Since passadores are assigned the same meat throughout the night, you might just be out of luck. Instead of waiting, we decided to utilize the special request option for filet minion but it took over half an hour before making its way to our table. If it wasn't Ercolano who is the passadore with the filet minion, I think service was meh - keeping in mind how busy it was for V-Day. This guy was on top of his game. He remembered exactly how we like our meats prepared. Impressive! Also kuddos to the passadore with the picanha who was very thorough at making sure we had enough. The ribeye and filet minion are my top picks. They are tender and delicious! If you are a carnivore, then this is the right place for you!",4.0
1928,"The only reason I left more than one star was because I have had a good experience here before.  That being said my girlfriend and I went for the Sunday brunch (it was her first time there) for our anniversary.  They immediately asked if we had a coupon (which I've never seen one before despite being on their email list) The moment we got there I put in a request for the cheese with honey since I know you need to special request it.  We mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary.  I ordered an extra spicy Bloody Mary... it was watery and not spicy in the slightest.  I then ordered the mango habanero cocktail thinking that would have some spice... I was wrong zero spice all the mango.  We then got two of the specialty shots that were offered for an extra price (no one mentioned it to us) they were horrid.  The cucumber smash was amazing as always though!  My girlfriend got the strawberry hibiscus cocktail and it was so disgusting she had me finish it for her (I didn't want to waste the money).  The waffles were black and burnt. There was no syrup or toppings for them (I had to request syrup).  Almost every single type of meat we had was burnt, overcooked, or both.  I requested my lamb rare several times and it came well done every time.  And it took almost an hour for the honey cheese to arrive despite me ordering it the moment we got there and constantly reminding the servers I had requested it.  No one wished us a happy anniversary (even though we went out of our way to mention we were celebrating it) or even asked if we wanted to order something for dessert.  We spent over $200 for our meals and drinks and unfortunately my girlfriend hated every second of the brunch.",0.0

1945,"Disaster. COVID has thrown us all challenges but if you aren't equipped to deal with them in a well thought out manner maybe don't open.Made a reservation for 4, boys dropped us off in the front and went to find parking which was not going to take long because well you know COVID. Hostesses said they couldn't seat us until everyone was there, understandable this is policy at many places. My friend went to the restroom. Meanwhile the hostess told me that after the other 2 in the party arrived it would be another 10-15 minutes while they found a waiter. The boys arrived after finding parking but the hostesses still refused to start the process of finding a waiter because one person was in the bathroom. Finally everyone was visible to the gate keepers and 15 minutes later we were sat.Apparently there are not enough heaters for the tables. We were sat next to a couple who had the lid of the heater angled completely to their table. Asked the waiter if it could be equal. He said no because they waited a long time for that heater. Another table left nearby and there was a heater so we asked to move which they were able to accommodate. The heater was only on about 1/4 power and was duct taped so no one could change it. Even with winter jackets we were freezing.Waiter came over to explain how things ""worked"" and we asked if we could order drinks and he said he'd be back for orders. 15 minutes later after getting the little cheese breads we finally saw the server again. Ordered drinks. Took another 15 minutes to get drinks. One pineapple old fashioned and a smokey something for the other 3. Probably should have gotten wine. Cocktails were meh. Meat came out presliced which I understand is adjusting to COVID but we never got anything but beef. Typically there is some lamb, chicken and pork. The guys serving the meat were timely and knowledgeable about what they were serving. Sadly meat was either bland or overly salted (and I love salt)Water was never refilled and it was impossible to find our waiter. Finally tracked down another sever and asked for the bill. After the experience we had it was PAINFUL to pay that bill. Two people in our party work at restaurants and even they really hated paying that bill. As I said if you don't have the capability of opening at least with a semi decent experience maybe you shouldn't.",5.0

1947,"All about that Churrasco experience. Excellent meats, attentive staff, and incredibly stuffing.It's hard to say no when the waiter brings a skewer full of meat. Most of the meats selections are incredibly tasty and the first 20 minutes are heaven. However, don't expect too much consistency in taste or rareness. Sometimes the same type of meat can be saltier or tougher than the last. It's so stuffing, you may feel repulsed by meat for the next couple days.But wow, that salad bar is amazing. The selection is huge and mostly complimentary to their meats. The fruits are very fresh and sweet. And I love their cured meat selection. The salmon they had at the salad bar was actually a little spoiled and smelled very very fishy. I did see the staff acknowledge this later on and change out the dish of salmon.The service is great but the waiters can be fairly sarcastic sometimes. They add a little spice to your experience but I could see their attitude seen as a little disrespectful.Big Tip: Sit towards the back near the kitchen or salad bar. When the servers with the skewers come out, they tend to serve these tables first. Tables near the entrance get meat that is not quite as fresh or hot.",5.0
1948,Had a wonderful time with Kelly and Diego. They were such gracious and kind hosts. They make you feel so special. They brought a true kindness and warmth.,2.0
1949,"So disappointed in this place!! Decided to go here for thanksgiving. Place was PACKED! Everyone wants to have a nice dinner prepared by Fogo. I have a particular cut of meat I enjoy... flank and skirt steak. So I'm expecting to see the gaucho come by with the skewers of that particular cut. I was there 1.5 hours and not a peep. During that 1.5 hrs asked several servers if they can send the gaucho my way... never came!!! Aside from that food is good, if you get what you want!!! I'd rather go to a Texas de Brasil ... so disappointed!!",4.0

1951,"The food, and service is worth every penny! The staff is attentive and very friendly except for one of the server the caucasian male server on 01 November 2019, between 7PM to 830PM but the rest of the staff was phenomenal so his bad attitude did not matter. As soon as you walk in you get the warm good feeling and very comfortable.  It is pricey but every food is excellent, my wife and daughter loves the french bread among other things. The meats are seasoned right, i remember every first bite of the meat.  The cheese bread is awesome but highly suggest that you don't eat to many to quickly as it will fill you up and will not be able to enjoy everything else.Thank you!!",1.0
1952,"This was the first time we visited the San Diego location. We usually go to the one in Beverly Hills. Parking is scarecrow so it's best to just use the restaurant's valet. Tip: walk out and request your car BEFORE your bill is paid--otherwise you will be waiting for a very long time.We made reservations in advance so we were seated as soon as we walked in the door. The main waitstaff was excellent. The people coming around with the meat passed by 50 times before stopping despite the green coaster placed up. Most of the meat was mediocre. The lamb chops and chicken breast with bacon was delicious. The salad bar was good but it would have been better if fruit selections were available. The rice and beans? No bueno :( Key lime pie? No bueno.The upside and reason for four stars is the main wait staff was friendly, attentive and tried to make it right. The bar made me a terrific, top-shelf strawberry martini-- despite it not being in the menu. After two--we're like:que sera, sera. :)",4.0
1953,Amazing food and a reasonable price considering how much I shoved into my mouth. Garlic steak continues to be the best thing on the planet. Our server Ryan was the highlight of our night. He checked on us and made sure we got all the food we needed and recommended some great drinks for us. Get that man a raise,0.0
1954,"I will say that I like this Brazilian steakhouse more than Rei Do Gado. It's not just the decor, either, though Rei Do Gado's decor did leave a lasting impression (or, scar) on my memory.Fogo's dining room is clean and open, airy and bright. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming, and full of some really good suggestions. She ran us through what to expect, how to request a meat that hadn't passed us by, and where to go for the non-meat-on-a-sword items before taking our drink orders and releasing us to the food stations.I have only a few ticks against Fogo. The first would be the complete lack of seafood in the buffet area. There was one slab of smoked salmon, but that was it. No shrimp, no crab or lobster legs, nothing other than that one large piece of salmon. They had a good selection of salads and side dishes, but I was really hoping for some shellfish to supplement our meat-tastic meal.The food really was very good. We tried to take our time about it, and to be picky about what we said yes to when the gauchos came by with their meaty offerings, but everything sounded so good when they described it, and our plates were quickly overrun by meat and meat and more meat.And into that, our waitress came out with three additional side dishes: some kind of sauteed banana (""it gets better the longer it sits!""), a fried polenta and some mashed potatoes. To this bounty, she added their gluten-free popovers.Oy.Everything we sampled that night was delicious. The polenta and mashed potatoes were good side dishes, and I fell in love with the popovers. The gauchos were expert at cutting and presenting us with the exact cut of meat at the exact temperature we had asked for. I didn't have one item that I didn't thoroughly enjoy, and I know my husband's experience was the same.That brings me to tick number two: there were several instances - not just a couple - where our little table notifier was set to the green - ""gimme meat!"" side, yet the gaucho with the drool-inducing meat-stick walked right on by. I tried to keep track of the ones that we missed so that I could ask our waitress or the next gaucho to send them back our way, but my mind was a jumble, and recalling one meat offering from another was a daunting task for me.My final tick for the night was that they completely ignored our celebration. They asked - and I told them - when making the reservation: we were celebrating my husband's birthday, and yet, nothing! Not a candle in a popover, not a sparkler in a cut of meat. Not even a, ""Happy birthday, sir"" upon entry. Super disappointing. Why bother asking if you're just going to ignore it? (It's a pet peeve of mine, if you couldn't tell).My husband wasn't nearly as upset by the snub as I was, which speaks volumes for his character. I felt like I had let him down, somehow. He was a good sport about it, though - it didn't diminish his dining experience or his memory of the restaurant itself, so that's a good thing...",4.0

1956,"Our server came one time to bring us waters knowing we wanted to order drinks. Had to flag down another server after 15 mins and then finally asked one of the meat cutter ladies to help us. Yesenia was the bomb! She got us Everything we asked for when our server was nowhere to be found. And she wasn't even a server! We didn't get served anything for at least 10-15 mins, our sides came close to the end of our meal, after getting another servers attention. Then to top it off, we sat there for a solid 20 minutes minimum waiting for someone to come take care of our check. Flagged another server who walked off after giving us the tab. Asked what looked like a manager or lead and they were not helpful in the least bit. One of the worst experiences we've ever had. I used to frequent SD and was taken back for a mini vacay by my SO and we got the worst service to date. How are you not going to take care of your guests? Let alone make sure we are checked out properly?? Or that we at least have sides or drink orders taken??",5.0

1959,"firstly, service at the dinner table was phenomenal, our server was andrea, she checked on us frequently and was extremely attentive and friendly. at first glance me and my partner we're frustrated because when we first arrived to put our name in we were told 10 minutes by the hostesses, then we waited about 20 minutes and saw multiple people who had reservations be seated before us. due to the fact they had reservations we thought it was okay to wait but grew impatient after it was a 20 min wait,  when the original wait time we were told was 10 min. so i asked the hostess how much longer she said she didn't know and i had to press her for more information, i asked her again for an estimate and she said 15 minutes. 25 minutes later we were finally seated. it was my partners birthday so i didn't want to go somewhere else after waiting for so long. that was my biggest issue, the fact that the hostess told me 10 when it was 20 then i asked again and was told by the same hostess i don't know, and that their is no seats because they don't have a table top for two. i then had to press her for an answer about an estimated wait time. it was frustrating that she gave me a wait time that was inaccurate twice. The hostess attitude was extremely disappointing but due to our waitress Andreas friendly and positive attitude she brightened our experience and made sure to give us a happy birthday dessert for my partner. i also would like to note we arrived at 6 pm it wasn't too busy at the time.",1.0

1961,"Had a great experience here a few weeks ago.  My cousin had a dinner here after a small wedding on the beach in La Jolla.  With all the COVID restrictions, they accommodated our group.  We sat outside in tents and it was tastefully decorated for our dinner.  I know the coordinator kept in good communication with my cousins with the constant changes with San Diego going from Red to Purple tier.  The experience is different and not as ""wowing"" with meat coming out sizzling and carved tableside.  The staff did an amazing job, they all wore masks and served everyone with all varieties of meats and sides.  They brought out more of any item if asked.  It was very organized and everything was amazing.  Our dinner came with all you can eat meat, sides, dessert and two drinks.  I don't drink but was offered a drink, which was similar to a mojito.  It had strawberries,  hibiscus and was refreshing.  My only complaint is that I wish I had more room to eat more food.  My favorite was the bottom sirloin, tasted like an upscale carne asada.  Bravo to Fogo for a delicious and memorable night.",5.0
